Machine-driven trading systems in the $5.1 trillion-a-day global currency market are struggling to cope with the blizzard of headlines about Britain's efforts to extricate itself from the European Union, making it more expensive and risky to bet for or against sterling. Prime Minister Theresa May's failure, after three attempts, to get her divorce deal with Brussels through parliament has sent the UK's planned departure careering off-piste, raising questions over who is in charge and when, how or even if the UK will actually leave. As a divided government battles a divided parliament over a way forward, the chorus of characters who can now influence events has grown, flummoxing news-reading algorithms, or 'algos', which are designed to parse phrases from recognized speakers before executing a trade. \"The model signals are more quantitative driven and rely on historical data feeds,\" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund currency sales at Mizuho in London. \"Brexit headlines have thrown a spanner in their works for the sheer number of characters moving the currency on a daily basis.\" News-reading algos are a growing part of a wider revolution on the trading floor of banks and asset managers, where machines have supplanted swathes of human traders, slashing costs and boosting the speed at which deals are done - sometimes down to millionths of a second. Traditionally designed to process economic data or central bank policy statements, some computer trading models have evolved to allow for split-second analysis of news headlines or Twitter storms before executing a buy or sell order. The problem for the computers is that Brexit is producing too many headlines for them to process. Reuters, for instance, has published up to 400 news headlines on Brexit per day in recent weeks, up from around 15 on British politics before it became an issue. Rival Bloomberg has also pumped up the volume of Brexit content by four times since last autumn, running more than 1,000 headlines some days - such as on March 12 when May's deal was defeated a second time, according to a spokeswoman. HAND SIGNALS The mechanics of how Brexit may be hammered out have also made it more difficult for the computers. Obscure British parliamentary procedures are now at the center of policymaking and people who typically would not feature in a computer trading model are suddenly taking center stage. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, for example, sent sterling skidding last month when he stopped May from bringing forward a vote on her deal. So sensitive is the currency to developments that even a hand signal can affect the price. On November 6, Britain's then Brexit Minister Dominic Raab, pushed the pound up simply by giving a \"thumbs up\" after a cabinet meeting -- a visual cue that would outfox machines programmed to analyze words. Raab's market-moving gesture came after the pound had fallen on a tweet warning of a no-deal Brexit from Jeffrey Donaldson, one of 10 Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers whose support May needs. (GRAPHIC: Day in the life of sterling - tmsnrt.rs/2IauH3h) Data is elusive on algorithms' exact share in sterling trade, it likely mirrors broader trends -- around 70 percent of orders in all currencies on the EBS platform, a major trading venue, are submitted via algorithms, the Bank of International Settlements estimated last September. That compares to a quarter in 2008. (GRAPHIC: Share of Etrading in FX - tmsnrt.rs/2V0Z8fV) There is no official data on what proportion of trade in foreign exchange is carried out by news-reading algos, but three currency traders at London-based banks estimated it was less than 10 percent. Given the complexities of Brexit, that proportion is likely to be even lower for trading sterling right now. Some hedge funds have opted out of trading sterling altogether because the usual models they rely on don't work in the current climate, according to one FX trader at a major UK investment bank. Their models are based around economic data and expectations for Bank of England rate changes, but those have become secondary drivers compared with political news, he said. He declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly about clients. Some banks are ensuring that trading the pound is not left completely to the machines while other banks are using tiny orders within narrow trading ranges to prevent large losses. \"If it was your job and given the complexity of the Brexit story, do you really want to precode something to automatically infer and put material risk on the back of that,\" said David Leigh, global head of FX spot and electronic trading at Deutsche Bank. \"Probably not.\" TURMOIL AND RISK AVERSION Market makers who provide liquidity by offering to buy and sell currencies on their own account also use algorithms to set bids and offers. But confusion around Brexit has made that more difficult too. To reduce the risk of getting caught on the wrong side of a headline, market makers are programming algorithms to offer a wider spread between the price they will buy, the bid, and sell, the offer. But a wider spread makes it more expensive to deal in pounds. Rob Turner, a quantitative trader at RBC Capital Markets said the average cost of trading, by taking into account the spreads, for sterling in a usual 10 million ticket jumped last week to 2.9 pips from 1.9 pips in October. \"That shows that the price at the very best moment for executing a sterling trade last week was still a lot worse than the worst moment in a normal week,\" Turner said. (GRAPHIC: Implied volatility in pound and euro - tmsnrt.rs/2V2lT2S) The upshot is less volume as investors stay on the sidelines and wait for the political drama to end. Daily cash volumes for sterling were around $65 billion in February, around 35 percent less than $100 billion traded before the Brexit referendum in June 2016, according to CLS, a major settler of foreign exchange trades. Sterling volatility, meanwhile, is at the highest levels in more than two years, having more than tripled from end-February lows, even while volatility elsewhere has declined. Overall, sterling has fallen 13 percent against the dollar since Britons voted to leave the European Union but the market is confused about its future direction. Buford Scott, managing partner at Stelrox Capital Management, a London-based family office which made money trading sterling during the Brexit referendum, said he was steering clear for now. \"Pound trading is characterised by turmoil and risk aversion resulting in wide ranges and largely directionless markets proving to be generally unprofitable for systematic strategies,\" Scott said.

But, helped by a model of healing dating back to the Holocaust, the 25-year-old has finished his education and blended into a new family, where individuals grieving lost loved ones have rebuilt their lives by caring for each other. \"People should not be driven by the past,\" the bearded young man told Reuters this week, as the country prepared to mark a quarter of a century since Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. \"I want to grow into someone who will benefit society.\" Seven years ago, Ruhumuriza's life was on course to become another small tragedy in a nation where every family is touched by grief. He and his mother lived in poverty. His father's death in the genocide was a mystery - the only time he ever tried to ask about it, his mother had a breakdown. \"Other people ... told how she was beaten, how she was tortured, got raped,\" he said. \"She became like a mad person. She got traumatized.\" THE PLACE WHERE TEARS ARE DRIED Then, in 2014, just as Ruhumuriza was about to drop out, his school got in touch with the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village, whose Hebrew-Kinyarwandan name translates as \"the place where tears are dried\". The village was set up in 2008 by a South African-born lawyer, Anne Heyman, who had worked in the United States. Heyman and her husband raised more than $12 million to help care for families ripped apart by the genocide, taking their model from Israel's Youth Villages, which created new families for children whose parents had died in the Holocaust. Rwanda's genocide, sparked by the assassination of the president, lasted around 100 days and stopped after rebels fought their way to the capital, led by Paul Kagame, Rwanda's current ruler. More than 95,000 children were orphaned, the United Nations estimates, and around 300,000 children were killed. For some of the survivors, Heyman's village offered healing and purpose. \"Having 15 children around you can calling you Mama, and you helping them to conquer their past, that is a great contribution to the nation,\" said Emeritha Mukarusagara, a slender, bespectacled 57-year-old with long braids who became a foster mother after being widowed in the genocide. She spent months hidden by a neighbor, heavily pregnant, terrified and filled with grief for her murdered husband. She keeps his picture on her phone but still cannot discuss his death. Since then, she has fostered dozens of vulnerable children, including Ruhumuriza, who needed families. NEW PURPOSE A shy teenager, he arrived into a large, boisterous community where children live 15 to a house, watched over by a strict but loving foster parent they are all encouraged to call Mama. It was strange to call another woman Mama, he said. It was even stranger to have a brother. He liked it. Ruhumuriza threw himself into his studies, becoming the school president, learning about Steve Jobs, and forming a deep bond with his foster mother. When he graduated and found a job in the construction industry, and a steady paycheck, he asked her what he should do with it. Go home, she said. Build a house for the lonely woman who gave birth to you. \"Now my mother lives in the house I built,\" he said proudly. \"Mama Emeritha is one of my cornerstones ... she is one of the best advisors I have.\" Ruhumuriza is one of more 850 children who has passed through the village's 26 houses. But although the children of the genocide have grown up, many more come seeking refuge: those orphaned by accidents and disease. Refugees from Burundi. Children at risk of abuse. Ruhumuriza, which was also the name of Mukarusagara's murdered husband, has a special place in his foster mother's heart. \"Every time I saw him, I remembered my dead husband. He was as kind as my husband,\" she said with a sigh. \"At his wedding party, I will put on the best attire I have and sit next to his mother.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Clement Uwiringiyimana</p> <p>AGAHOZO SHALOM YOUTH VILLAGE, Rwanda (Reuters) - Vicent de Paul Ruhumuriza was born in Rwanda just a few months before genocide consigned his father to an unknown grave and traumatized his mother so badly she still screams and shakes at any mention of that time. </p> <p>But, helped by a model of healing dating back to the Holocaust, the 25-year-old has finished his education and blended into a new family, where individuals grieving lost loved ones have rebuilt their lives by caring for each other. </p> <p>\"People should not be driven by the past,\" the bearded young man told Reuters this week, as the country prepared to mark a quarter of a century since Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. \"I want to grow into someone who will benefit society.\" </p> <p>Seven years ago, Ruhumuriza's life was on course to become another small tragedy in a nation where every family is touched by grief. </p> <p>He and his mother lived in poverty.

The doomed flight repeatedly nosedived as the pilots battled to control the nearly full aircraft before it crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in clear conditions, Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday. \"The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft,\" Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference, presenting the outlines of a preliminary report, Investigators are expected to publish the report by Friday. Boeing's top-selling aircraft has been grounded worldwide since the March 10 disaster, which came just five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX crash in Indonesia that killed 189. An initial report into that accident also raised questions about the jet's software, as well as training and maintenance. Families of the victims, regulators and travelers around the world have been waiting for signs of whether the two crashes are linked, and the extent to which Boeing technology and the actions of the Ethiopian Airlines pilots played a role. Ethiopian investigators did not blame anyone for the crash, in line with international rules requiring civil probes to focus on technical recommendations for safer flight. Nor did they give a detailed analysis of the flight, which is expected to take several months before a final report due within a year. But in a clear indication of where Ethiopian investigators are directing the attention of regulators, they cleared the pilots of using incorrect procedures and issued two safety recommendations focused on the recently introduced aircraft. They suggested that Boeing review the flight control system and that aviation authorities confirm any changes before allowing that model of plane back into the air. \"Since repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed ... it is recommended that the aircraft control system shall be reviewed by the manufacturer,\" Dagmawit said. The nose-down commands were issued by Boeing's so-called MCAS software. The preliminary report into the Lion Air disaster suggested pilots lost control after grappling with MCAS, a new automated anti-stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose of the aircraft based on faulty data from a sensor. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has come under fire over the way it decided to certify the MCAS software, cautioned the investigation had not yet concluded. \"We continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident. As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,\" the U.S. agency said in a statement. Boeing said it would study the report once it was released. NO TENSIONS Ethiopian Airlines said its crew had followed all the correct guidance to handle a difficult emergency. However, the report could spark a debate with Boeing about how crew responded to problems triggered by faulty data from an airflow sensor, particularly over whether they steadied the plane before turning key software off. Questions on whether the pilots had leveled out the plane before disengaging MCAS and how many times MCAS activated were not answered in a news conference that lasted about 40 minutes. Following a previous Ethiopian Airlines accident off Beirut in 2010, Addis Ababa authorities rejected the conclusions of a Lebanese investigation citing pilot error and suggested the aircraft had exploded in a possible act of sabotage. Officials denied reports of tensions between Ethiopian officials and U.S. and other foreign investigators accredited to the current probe. \"We don't have any reservations from different stakeholders who were engaged in the investigations,\" chief investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said. Aviation safety analyst Paul Hayes said deeper investigation would delve into the role played by software and how pilots were able to respond, and said he hoped scars from the 2010 dispute would not get in the way of a comprehensive investigation. \"Pilots shouldn't have to cope with such an emergency situation. We need to understand what are the factors that meant these two crews were overcome,\" said Hayes, safety director at UK-based consultancy Flight Ascend. \"It is unusual for there to be a single cause,\" he added. Boeing said on Wednesday it had successfully tested an update of the MCAS software designed to make it easier to handle.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jason Neely</p> <p>ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian investigators urged Boeing to review its flight control technology and said pilots of state carrier Ethiopian Airlines had carried out proper procedures in the first public findings on the crash of a 737 MAX jet that killed 157 people.</p> <p>The doomed flight repeatedly nosedived as the pilots battled to control the nearly full aircraft before it crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in clear conditions, Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday.</p> <p>\"The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft,\" Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference, presenting the outlines of a preliminary report,</p> <p>Investigators are expected to publish the report by Friday.</p> <p>Boeing's top-selling aircraft has been grounded worldwide since the March 10 disaster, which came just five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX crash in Indonesia that killed 189.

The taking of Gharyan after skirmishes on Wednesday with forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj culminated a rapid thrust westwards by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) from his eastern stronghold of Benghazi. The developments signified a serious escalation of the conflict in Libya that has dragged on since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. \"We fully control Gharyan and right now as we speak I'm driving through the town,\" Abdelsalam al-Hassi, commander of the operation to secure western Libya, told Reuters by telephone. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres meanwhile appealed for restraint by the rival factions. Libya has been divided between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel administration allied to Haftar since Gaddafi's downfall. Gharyan, lying in the Western mountains about 100 km due south of the capital, had been allied to the Tripoli government. The two sides fought skirmishes on Wednesday but these had ceased, town mayor Yousef al-Bdairi said earlier on Thursday. A town resident told Reuters: \"The town now is under control of the army who came from the east and I can see their vehicles with their Libyan National Army logo.\" Guterres, who arrived in Tripoli on Wednesday to promote peace talks, said in a tweet before Gharyan's capture that he was deeply concerned by the military movements and the risk of confrontation. \"There is no military solution. Only intra-Libyan dialogue can solve Libyan problems. I call for calm and restraint as I prepare to meet the Libyan leaders in the country,\" he said. SETBACK The developments are a setback for the United Nations and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar, who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power-sharing deal. A national conference is set to follow this month to agree on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and a hub for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara in the hope of reaching Europe. Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as bulwark against Islamists. His opponents see in him as a new Gaddafi. His forces control the east and recently expanded to southern Libya. There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli government, which has issued a general alert for its forces in response to the eastern advance. Analysts doubt the LNA is capable of launching a full-scale attack as it has stretched itself with the southern advance and it also relies on tribesmen and other auxiliary forces.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman Werfali</p> <p>TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces on Thursday took full control of Gharyan, a town about 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Tripoli, the force commander and residents said.</p> <p>The taking of Gharyan after skirmishes on Wednesday with forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj culminated a rapid thrust westwards by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) from his eastern stronghold of Benghazi.</p> <p>The developments signified a serious escalation of the conflict in Libya that has dragged on since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p> <p>\"We fully control Gharyan and right now as we speak I'm driving through the town,\" Abdelsalam al-Hassi, commander of the operation to secure western Libya, told Reuters by telephone.</p> <p>U.N.

The request, in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump's income taxes and business network, which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations. \"It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials. To maintain trust in our democracy, the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly, as laws intend,\" Neal said in a statement. IRS and U.S. Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment. Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president, saying his returns were \"under audit\" by the IRS. Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties. Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U.S. military leaders on Wednesday. \"Is that all?\" the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns. \"Usually it's 10, so I guess they're giving up,\" he said. \"I've been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name, you're audited. But until such time as I'm not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.\" Neal based his request on his committee's oversight jurisdiction of the IRS, specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president. OVERSIGHT PRESSURE Congressional Republicans oppose Neal's effort, saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U.S. citizen into a political weapon. \"This particular request is an abuse of the tax-writing committees' statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of ... the Internal Revenue Code,” Representative Kevin Brady, the committee's top Republican, said in a statement. Independent analysts welcomed the move. \"The Ways and Means Committee's strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington. It was the third time this week a Democratic-led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump. Earlier on Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full investigation report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday. Neal's committee initially planned to request only Trump's personal tax returns. But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president's activity in the private sector. The request includes returns for eight entities: Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC, DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp, LFB Acquisition Member Corp, LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club. A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump's business activity. Although Trump has never released his returns, the New York Times last year cited a \"vast trove\" of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes. The White House called the report misleading.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By David Morgan</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic head of a powerful U.S. House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns on Wednesday, in a long-awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House.</p> <p>The request, in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump's income taxes and business network, which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations.</p> <p>\"It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials.

An announcement is expected later this month. In recent days, four women have said Biden made them feel uncomfortable when he touched them at political events in past years. \"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying,\" Biden said in the two-minute video posted on Twitter. \"I will be much more mindful, and that’s my responsibility,\" he said. \"I’ve worked my whole life to empower women. I’ve worked my whole life to prevent abuse.\" After a former Nevada politician, Lucy Flores, said last week that Biden made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused” when he kissed the back of her head at a 2014 campaign event, Biden released a statement saying he believed he never acted inappropriately during his many years in public life. Three more women followed suit with similar complaints. Biden’s political team has tried to contain the damage, encouraging women who have known him to come forward with positive accounts of their interactions with him. Flores could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. She supported U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 Democratic presidential campaign. Sanders is running again, and his campaign has denied any involvement in her going public with her story. There was no immediate response to Biden’s statement from leading Democratic contenders. U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O’Rourke, among others, have expressed sympathy for Biden’s accusers and have said they deserve to be heard. President Donald Trump poked fun at Biden on Tuesday over the allegations. On Wednesday, the Republican president, who during his 2016 campaign faced multiple accusations from women of unwanted sexual contact, wished his potential rival luck, saying it was up to Biden to decide if he should apologize. Biden, 76, has long been known for a warm and intimate campaign style. He served eight years as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama after 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. But his propensity for hugging and physical touching has come under new scrutiny in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp as awareness about sexual assault and harassment has grown and damaged the careers of dozens of men in politics and entertainment accused of sexual misconduct. CAMPAIGN PREPARATIONS Sources close to Biden told Reuters that preparations for a run had not been slowed by the controversy. “I don’t think there is anything to change the work we are doing,” one source connected to the putative campaign said. Another source who has been in contact with Biden’s team said the flap over his personal conduct had been anticipated. Both sources asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the campaign. A top Biden donor, New York attorney James Kreindler, said his support of Biden had been unshaken by the controversy. Dick Harpootlian, a prominent lawyer in Democratic Party circles in South Carolina, added he did not think it would harm Biden's bid. Public opinion polls have consistently shown Biden to be atop the 2020 field, which features more than a dozen candidates. There is yet to be any evidence that he has suffered lasting political damage from the accusations. Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist in Chicago and former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, said Biden’s supporters were largely familiar with his public persona and unlikely to desert him over the issue. The challenge for Biden if he does mount a run, Sefl said, was to appeal to voters who may be more skeptical about his behavior. She suggested he place women in high-profile roles within his campaign as one way to send a signal he is adapting to the times. She also encouraged him to talk about his work supporting causes such as the Violence Against Women Act, which Biden sponsored while in the Senate.

Germany's figures showed industrial orders fell at their sharpest rate in more than two years in February, driven largely by a slump in foreign demand. It compounded signs that Europe's largest economy has had a feeble start to the year, left the euro stuck at near $1.12, sent German Bund yields back below zero and looked set to end a four-day run of gains for share traders. [.EU][/FRX] Futures pointed to a flat restart for Wall Street later too. MSCI's broadest index of Asia shares also lost 0.3 percent overnight after five straight days of gains had taken it to the highest level since late August. Losses were led by Australia and New Zealand while Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indian markets were also in the red and Japan's Nikkei paused near a recent one-month top. Chinese shares were firmer again though, with the blue-chip index ending up 1 percent which left them at a new one-year high and up nearly 40 percent since the start of the year. [.SS] \"We are expecting quite a constructive agreement between the U.S. and China when it comes to trade,\" said AllianceBernstein China Portfolio Manager John Lin. He added it was probably now a consensus view among major investors and if it proved right, would raise other questions such as whether China's government would \"keep its foot on the (stimulus) pedal or ease off a bit.\" Risk sentiment has otherwise been supported this week by signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday the two sides aimed to bridge differences during talks, which could extend beyond three days this week. Investors are keen to see if ongoing talks lead to an earlier-than-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to sign an accord. Trump will meet Vice Premier Liu He at the White House later. \"Also an important question would be whether an agreement would be sufficient to revive business sentiment and the global trade cycle,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management Asia Pacific Chief Market Strategist Tai Hui added. \"We believe on the margin it would help, but practically all investors we’ve spoken to in Asia in the past six months believe friction will still flare up from time to time. Various media reported on Thursday the United States wanted to set a 2025 target for China to meet trade pledges. The plan would see China committing to buy more U.S. commodities, including soybeans and energy products, and allow full foreign ownership for U.S. companies operating in China as a binding pledge. \"We're covering issues that have never really been covered before, including enforcement,\" Kudlow had said.

But Labor said higher earners would receive less benefits than what the government proposed to fund bigger concessions for people on less than A$45,000. \"The Liberals talk so much about being back in the black but the budget papers reveal a much paler shade of grey,\" Labor leader Bill Shorten told Australia's parliament. \"We believe that Australia does best when working class and middle-class Australia gets a fair go.\" The government's budget promised A$158 billion in tax cuts though the bulk was set to come after 2023 by reducing higher tax brackets.

Initial results from the elections showed the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) had narrowly won control of Turkey's two biggest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, in an upset for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP). In Istanbul, CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, and his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25,000 votes ahead, a very slim margin in a city of some 15 million people. However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara, saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities. On Wednesday, Turkey's High Election Board (YSK) ruled in favour of a recount of votes in 18 of the city's 39 districts, while the AKP said the difference was narrowing as the recounts continued. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul's Gungoren district on Thursday, Imamoglu said that recounts had been completed in nine or ten districts, and urged the YSK to respect its regulations during the counting process. \"The results will not change. Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service, so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible. I hope it's resolved as soon as possible,\" Imamoglu said. In the capital Ankara, the YSK ordered the recount of votes in 11 districts, after the AKP objected to initial results that saw opposition candidate Mansur Yavas defeat his AKP rival, former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki, by nearly 4 percentage points. If the initial results are confirmed, the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32.6 billion liras ($5.79 billion) for 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey's commercial hub, and the capital Ankara. Erdogan - who campaigned amid almost total media domination for the AKP - would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities, possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession. While official results have not yet been announced, Erdogan has said his alliance won the majority of municipal councils across Istanbul and Ankara. The AKP has said this was a sign of irregularity in the vote count. The CHP has said that a recount would not change the outcome of the elections, and Imamoglu on Wednesday called on the YSK to \"do its job\" and mandate him as Istanbul's elected mayor. \"I just keep on laughing at this whole process, but at least the people are finally smiling,\" Imamoglu said on Thursday.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu</p> <p>ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition candidate in Istanbul said on Thursday a recount of Sunday's local election votes was partially complete and the difference between him and the ruling AK party candidate remained around 20,000.</p> <p>Initial results from the elections showed the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) had narrowly won control of Turkey's two biggest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, in an upset for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP).</p> <p>In Istanbul, CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, and his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25,000 votes ahead, a very slim margin in a city of some 15 million people. </p> <p>However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara, saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Turkey's High Election Board (YSK) ruled in favour of a recount of votes in 18 of the city's 39 districts, while the AKP said the difference was narrowing as the recounts continued.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in Istanbul's Gungoren district on Thursday, Imamoglu said that recounts had been completed in nine or ten districts, and urged the YSK to respect its regulations during the counting process.</p> <p>\"The results will not change.

The 240-186 vote was a largely symbolic move aimed at keeping the spotlight on the issue. Just eight Republicans joined majority Democrats in voting to urge the administration to reverse its assault against Obamacare, as the 2010 Affordable Care Act that overhauled the U.S. healthcare system is popularly known. House Democrats brought the resolution to force lawmakers to take a stand on the Justice Department's recent move asking an appeals court to overturn Obamacare on constitutional grounds. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pledged to deliver a better healthcare system than Obamacare if the Supreme Court tosses out his predecessor's signature domestic achievement. \"The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration's vicious campaign to take away their healthcare,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said. But Republicans called the resolution a \"political stunt\". Representative Kevin Brady said that if the Supreme Court did strike down Obamacare, Republicans would act to protect some provisions, including coverage guarantees for people with pre-existing medical conditions. Trump says his administration is drawing up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election that could be implemented soon afterwards, assuming he wins re-election and Republicans win back the House and keep the Senate. But Democrats say some 20 million people could lose insurance if the courts toss out Obamacare. They have happily seized on the issue again after having won control of the House last November while campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare. \"The president’s view will make 2020 all about healthcare,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. \"I would suggest that’s good for us (Democrats). The American people are for having access to care.\" Some Republicans who voted with Democrats Wednesday were from \"swing\" districts, and may worry that opposing Obamacare could be a liability when they face the voters again next year.

Like many of the country's seaside towns, it is battling decline and voted heavily to quit the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum.","articleBody":"By Clodagh Kilcoyne and Sara Ledwith SKEGNESS, England (Reuters) - On a Sunday evening in March, Evelyn Ovington and her granddaughter Dana Marie went to play bingo as usual in their local town hall near Skegness, a resort on the east coast of England. Like many of the country's seaside towns, it is battling decline and voted heavily to quit the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Top prizes at the club that night included the ingredients for a chicken dinner. Dana Marie, who had just turned 18, marked her coming-of-age by drinking a can of beer. She and her 59-year-old gran joked with the rest of the crowd, spanning all ages, as they waited for the numbers to be called in the traditional way. When the caller said, \"The street where she lives, Theresa May,\" the players recognized the reference to the prime minister's residence in Downing Street: Number 10. But bingo calls are about as close as Evelyn Ovington expects to get to Theresa May. As the target deadline for Britain to quit the EU approached, Ovington and dozens of others whom Reuters met on a 14-day tour along England's coastline said they felt increasingly let down by politicians. In line with recent opinion polls nationwide, few had changed their minds about backing Brexit. In these coastal areas, the majority still wanted to leave Europe. \"Get us out of there and get us our own nation back. That's what I say,\" said Ovington. \"(I'm) just fed up with all the money that they give to the EU when we can spend it here. I want out.\" Britain as a whole voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union. But around England's coastline, dislike of EU was and is much more marked. A tally of the results as estimated by Chris Hanretty, a professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, shows more than 100 of the 120 or so English parliamentary constituencies that have a coastline voted to leave. Reuters visited 10 of them: eight where most people voted to leave, and two where a majority chose to stay. From Skegness on the east coast to Morecambe Bay in the west, dozens of people said they were still convinced their fortunes could only improve outside the EU. The main exception was Brighton, a southern town nicknamed \"London-on-Sea,\" partly for its appeal to those with jobs in the capital who have an hour-long commute to work. In this cosmopolitan, affluent university town, a clear majority voted to remain in the European community, which the UK joined in 1973. The overall results reflect a wider trend. Across Europe, economic and industrial decline are driving anti-EU sentiment, according to a European Commission study from December 2018. The paper, \"The Geography of EU Discontent,\" found that areas with lower employment or a less-educated workforce are more likely to vote anti-EU. In England's case, Brexit also highlights a new layer in the political divide, which Prime Minister May alluded to in 2016 when she pledged to help those \"left behind\" by globalisation. Big cities are becoming younger, more ethnically diverse, more educated and more socially liberal, while smaller towns are ageing, are less diverse, more nostalgic and more socially conservative, studies by political geographers show. All around the coastline, whether people voted Leave or Remain, they expressed nostalgic regret for a time when there was more opportunity - and kindness. \"I think we used to take care of our communities a bit more,\" said Brighton-based web designer and massage therapist Chris Baker, adding it was easy to be too romantic about the past. \"I think, you know, we had more manners, we were nicer to people on the street.\" For Ovington, the problem is very real: She worries that her granddaughter's 18th birthday brings nearer the moment when Dana Marie, like other young people in the region, will move away to university and work. Ovington hopes Brexit means the local council can claim funds that in her view are currently being mis-directed into Europe, and invest them in a future for local young people. \"At the moment there is no future for them, there's nothing,\" she said. \"So out of Brexit, they'll get more funding, help the kids more.\" SKEGNESS, LINCOLNSHIRE Coastal regions were targeted in the run-up to the referendum by the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). While UKIP has since lost ground, the frustrations it tapped remain. Populations on the coast are typically older, whiter, less well-educated and poorer than the average. In 2013, Skegness was designated the \"most deprived seaside area in Britain\" in a study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). And in 2016 the constituency returned the biggest \"Leave\" vote in the country, at more than 75 percent, according to Hanretty. Skegness was the site of the first Butlin's holiday camp for workers in the 1930s, and is still a popular seaside destination in the summer. But it sits in a poor farming region and has yet to attract year-round visitors. The mean age of just over 44 in Skegness is older than the English average of just over 39, census data from 2011 shows. More than 93 percent of people in the area said they were white and of English or British nationalities, compared with just under 80 percent in England on average. Around 40 percent of people in the Skegness area said they had no qualifications. \"It's been going downhill for a long time,\" said Dana Marie of the town, adding she would have voted to leave the EU if she had been old enough. She is studying biology, sociology and health and social care at school, and works part time in a Burger King. \"Obviously it's seasonal, so during the summer it's really really good, but during the winter it's terrible.\" In 2010, average hourly pay for people living in the Skegness area was about three-quarters of the British average. By 2018, it had fallen further behind: The national average was 14.36 pounds an hour, according to the ONS. But people living in and around Skegness were making just over 10 pounds an hour. On a Sunday night in a pub in Wainfleet near Skegness, father and son John and Andrew Eldin were almost the only customers. John, 77, said that to stay in Europe would be to be \"ruled by a load of boneheads. I voted out. Because I remembered how good it was before we went in.\" Eldin and his son, a heavy goods driver and mechanic, spoke heatedly about how there has been diminishing care for old farm hands in the region who have been afflicted by arthritis after years harvesting cabbages. Now, they said, locals are undermined in the jobs market by immigrants from eastern Europe who have freedom of access, and also compete for schools and healthcare. REDCAR, NORTH YORKSHIRE A militant mood is mounting in Redcar, a small town devastated in 2015 by the closure of its steelworks with the loss of around 3,000 jobs. In January, local media reported, demonstrators marched in yellow vests with the slogan \"leave means leave\" to urge their member of parliament, who backed the Remain campaign, to quit. The politician did not step down and tensions still run high. \"Life's gonna change after this because of the politicians\" who run the country, said Kevin Calvey, an unemployed 64-year-old. \"Everything's gonna be contested from now on.\" He thinks London is absorbing investment that the rest of the country needs. A new rail link across the capital is costing some $22 billion. The government's refusal to grant a loan to the Redcar steelworks forced the plant to close. Redcar is a relatively young town, but more than a quarter of residents have no qualifications. Relative pay has declined since 2010. \"London just needs feeding all the time, to the detriment of the rest of the country,\" said Calvey. He said he voted to leave the EU \"because I didn't want the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels telling us what to do.\" Fish-and-chip shop owner and Leave voter Mark Scorer works in Redcar because businesses in his home town of Sunderland were too expensive to take on, he said. \"I just think Britain's been on the decline since the 80s,\" he said. \"There's not much out there for people, sometimes people have got to move away to get jobs. They go to university to get these degrees and then they move to London ... which is a shame.\" Further up the coast, a postcard on sale in the former fishing town of Whitby depicted the shuttered hulk of Redcar's steelworks above a banner, \"dystopia-on-sea.\" WHITBY, NORTH YORKSHIRE In Whitby harbor, kipper smoker Derek Brown said his family has been in the business for 146 years. For the past 30 or so, he says, the fish he has been smoking has had to be imported from Norway and Iceland because herring can no longer be found off the coast. The reasons for this include overfishing and climate change, but he felt London and Brussels have not helped. When Britain joined the then European Economic Community, the country opened its fishing waters to other states, which today catch more in UK waters than do UK boats. \"I want change,\" Brown said. \"Hopefully we'll get our fishing grounds back.\" Pay in the Whitby area has picked up since 2010, but still lags the British average. A higher-than-average share of people say they have no qualifications, and in the 2011 census, 97 percent gave their nationalities as white English or British variants. Guest house and tea shop owner Alice Raven, 27, said she didn't vote in the referendum but she sees more opportunities for England outside the EU. Her gothic-themed cafe plays on Whitby's appeal as the site where the 19th-century novelist Bram Stoker brought his villain, Count Dracula, into England. \"I think leaving would be the best option,\" she said, sitting next to a skeleton outside her tea rooms. \"I don't think you can trust any of the government at the moment.\" MORECAMBE, LANCASHIRE On the northwest coast, fisherwoman Margaret Owen, just back from delivering a batch of sprats to feed the seals in Blackpool Zoo, was boiling over at the politicians' ignorance. She said it was preventing her from earning a living. In the summer months Owen, 66, uses a haaf net, an ancient technique dating back to the Vikings to catch salmon and sea trout as they head upriver. The job is dangerous: Users manipulate a device like a cutdown soccer goal post while standing in deep, fast-running water. Owen has until recently been licensed to fish in this traditional way. But now salmon are an endangered species, and from this year she has been told that EU regulations mean she must discard any salmon she catches. This, she says, is unrealistic, not least because she sometimes fishes at night. \"I stand in the water up to my chest,\" she said. \"It can be pitch black, turbulent, raining, sand's going from under your feet. You get it (the fish) in the net, it goes right to the back of the net. You've got to catch it, kill it, and put it on your belt and let me tell you, I haven't got time to say, 'Are you a sea trout or a salmon?'\" Owen said she originally wanted out of the EU: \"We were hoping for a change for everybody.\" But now, she says she has changed her mind, because talks so far don't look like delivering what the fishing industry hoped. Other fishermen in Morecambe Bay gather shellfish, such as cockles and mussels, for export, mainly to southern Europe. Leaving could restrict their access to European markets, but two of them said they still wanted out, even though they worried about the potential impact on their business. UK cockle fisheries made over four million pounds in 2017. The EU was originally set up for fair trading, said one of these fishermen, Michael Wilson, but it hasn't worked out like that. \"We've countries joining with no money and we were providing money, so it was time to get out or go independent, I think.\" BRIGHTON, EAST SUSSEX The Leave vote cuts little ice in Brighton on the south coast, one of the few coastal towns with a clear majority in favor of remaining in Europe. In the wealthier part of town, almost three-quarters of voters wanted to stay in Europe. \"I believe that the Leave campaign was based entirely on lies and there was no way I was going to vote in support of that,\" said Ruby McMahon, a 22-year-old literature graduate who works in a clothing store. She came to Brighton in 2015 to go to university, and said she stayed because she had been raised \"in a very conservative backwards town.\" Brighton's demographic profile is almost the mirror image of Skegness. People who live in the town, which houses the UK headquarters of American Express, earn more than the British average – almost 10 percent more in Brighton Pavilion, the richer part of town. The mean age, at 37, is younger than average, according to the 2011 census. Almost 40 percent are educated to the highest level, and around 20 percent of residents say their ethnicity is not white English or British. McMahon – like the Ovingtons in Skegness – said her vote was partly driven by her aspirations for the future. But where the Ovingtons want more opportunities at home, McMahon worries that Brexit will damage her chances of living and working outside England: Once outside the European Union, Britons may no longer enjoy freedom of movement. \"I'm scared of how badly handled it's been,\" she said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Clodagh Kilcoyne and Sara Ledwith</p> <p>SKEGNESS, England (Reuters) - On a Sunday evening in March, Evelyn Ovington and her granddaughter Dana Marie went to play bingo as usual in their local town hall near Skegness, a resort on the east coast of England. Like many of the country's seaside towns, it is battling decline and voted heavily to quit the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p> <p>Top prizes at the club that night included the ingredients for a chicken dinner. Dana Marie, who had just turned 18, marked her coming-of-age by drinking a can of beer. She and her 59-year-old gran joked with the rest of the crowd, spanning all ages, as they waited for the numbers to be called in the traditional way. When the caller said, \"The street where she lives, Theresa May,\" the players recognized the reference to the prime minister's residence in Downing Street: Number 10.</p> <p>But bingo calls are about as close as Evelyn Ovington expects to get to Theresa May. As the target deadline for Britain to quit the EU approached, Ovington and dozens of others whom Reuters met on a 14-day tour along England's coastline said they felt increasingly let down by politicians. In line with recent opinion polls nationwide, few had changed their minds about backing Brexit. In these coastal areas, the majority still wanted to leave Europe.</p> <p>\"Get us out of there and get us our own nation back. That's what I say,\" said Ovington. \"(I'm) just fed up with all the money that they give to the EU when we can spend it here. I want out.\"</p> <p>Britain as a whole voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union. But around England's coastline, dislike of EU was and is much more marked. A tally of the results as estimated by Chris Hanretty, a professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, shows more than 100 of the 120 or so English parliamentary constituencies that have a coastline voted to leave. Reuters visited 10 of them: eight where most people voted to leave, and two where a majority chose to stay. From Skegness on the east coast to Morecambe Bay in the west, dozens of people said they were still convinced their fortunes could only improve outside the EU.</p> <p>The main exception was Brighton, a southern town nicknamed \"London-on-Sea,\" partly for its appeal to those with jobs in the capital who have an hour-long commute to work. In this cosmopolitan, affluent university town, a clear majority voted to remain in the European community, which the UK joined in 1973.</p> <p>The overall results reflect a wider trend. Across Europe, economic and industrial decline are driving anti-EU sentiment, according to a European Commission study from December 2018. The paper, \"The Geography of EU Discontent,\" found that areas with lower employment or a less-educated workforce are more likely to vote anti-EU.</p> <p>In England's case, Brexit also highlights a new layer in the political divide, which Prime Minister May alluded to in 2016 when she pledged to help those \"left behind\" by globalisation. Big cities are becoming younger, more ethnically diverse, more educated and more socially liberal, while smaller towns are ageing, are less diverse, more nostalgic and more socially conservative, studies by political geographers show.</p> <p>All around the coastline, whether people voted Leave or Remain, they expressed nostalgic regret for a time when there was more opportunity - and kindness. \"I think we used to take care of our communities a bit more,\" said Brighton-based web designer and massage therapist Chris Baker, adding it was easy to be too romantic about the past. \"I think, you know, we had more manners, we were nicer to people on the street.\"</p> <p>For Ovington, the problem is very real: She worries that her granddaughter's 18th birthday brings nearer the moment when Dana Marie, like other young people in the region, will move away to university and work.</p> <p>Ovington hopes Brexit means the local council can claim funds that in her view are currently being mis-directed into Europe, and invest them in a future for local young people. \"At the moment there is no future for them, there's nothing,\" she said. \"So out of Brexit, they'll get more funding, help the kids more.\"</p> <p></p> <p>SKEGNESS, LINCOLNSHIRE</p> <p>Coastal regions were targeted in the run-up to the referendum by the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). While UKIP has since lost ground, the frustrations it tapped remain.</p> <p>Populations on the coast are typically older, whiter, less well-educated and poorer than the average. In 2013, Skegness was designated the \"most deprived seaside area in Britain\" in a study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). And in 2016 the constituency returned the biggest \"Leave\" vote in the country, at more than 75 percent, according to Hanretty.</p> <p>Skegness was the site of the first Butlin's holiday camp for workers in the 1930s, and is still a popular seaside destination in the summer. But it sits in a poor farming region and has yet to attract year-round visitors.</p> <p>The mean age of just over 44 in Skegness is older than the English average of just over 39, census data from 2011 shows. More than 93 percent of people in the area said they were white and of English or British nationalities, compared with just under 80 percent in England on average. Around 40 percent of people in the Skegness area said they had no qualifications.</p> <p>\"It's been going downhill for a long time,\" said Dana Marie of the town, adding she would have voted to leave the EU if she had been old enough.

Four men, two Iraqi and two Syrians, were sentenced to death by a Baghdad court on Oct 30 on charges of membership of Islamic State, a banned terrorist organization, Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said. Their identity has not been revealed but she described them in a statement as \"four senior affiliates of the ISIL leadership\", using a widespread acronym for the militant group. \"The trial should have shed light on the inner workings of ISIL and created a crucial judicial record of ISIL crimes against people.” The jihadist group, which took large swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014, declared a \"caliphate\" and imposed a reign of terror with public beheadings and sexual enslavement of women and girls including from the Iraqi Yazidi sect. It lost its last territorial stronghold in Syria last month. \"The Government of Iraq should take appropriate steps to prosecute the crimes perpetrated against the Iraqi people, including alleged genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,\" Callamard said. \"At the very least, the Iraqi prosecutors should have brought additional charges from the Iraqi penal code, such as charges of murder, torture or disappearance, against the defendants, for the purpose of accountability,” she said. International standards guaranteeing a fair trial appear not to have been met at the \"hasty\" criminal proceedings, during which the men were denied access to legal counsel, Callamard said. Despite widespread violations, no victims or their families participated in the trial at Karkh criminal court or presented testimony, she said. Callamard, who made recommendations about criminal accountability after a visit to Iraq in 2017, said on Thursday that the right to truth about gross human rights violations is an inalienable right. \"There is no justice delivered in secrecy,” she said. “The trial of these four ISIL senior leaders should be an important opportunity for the victims, victims’ families, and witnesses to report on their ordeals and to be heard,\" she said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Stephanie Nebehay</p> <p>GENEVA (Reuters) - Iraq must ensure that Islamic State leadership faces justice for alleged war crimes and genocide against civilians, not just charges of belonging to a terrorist group, a United Nations human rights investigator said on Thursday.</p> <p>Four men, two Iraqi and two Syrians, were sentenced to death by a Baghdad court on Oct 30 on charges of membership of Islamic State, a banned terrorist organization, Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said.</p> <p>Their identity has not been revealed but she described them in a statement as \"four senior affiliates of the ISIL leadership\", using a widespread acronym for the militant group.</p> <p>\"The trial should have shed light on the inner workings of ISIL and created a crucial judicial record of ISIL crimes against people.”</p> <p>The jihadist group, which took large swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014, declared a \"caliphate\" and imposed a reign of terror with public beheadings and sexual enslavement of women and girls including from the Iraqi Yazidi sect.

The SEC has said that Musk used Twitter to update investors on Tesla's production outlook without getting required approval from company lawyers. Musk countered that the tweet contained nothing new and did not need advance approval. The following is a sampling of some of Musk's more notable posts on Twitter, where he now has more than 25 million followers. \"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019.\" -- Feb. 19, 2019. The tweet that prompted the SEC contempt motion. Musk has said the tweet merely restated outlook he provided on a Jan. 30, 2019 conference call, when he said production \"may be on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.\" \"Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!\" -- Oct. 4, 2018. Musk was attacking both the SEC and short-sellers by renaming the regulator just one week after being sued over the \"funding secured\" tweet. Twelve days after this tweet, he and Tesla reached their settlement with the SEC. \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" -- Aug. 7, 2018. The tweet that prompted the SEC lawsuit. Musk was not close to taking Tesla private, and had not lined up financing. Tesla's share price traded as much as 13.3 percent higher following the tweet, which occurred during market hours. Musk tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018 that Tesla would remain public. \"They have about three weeks before their short position explodes\" -- June 17, 2018. Musk frequently uses Twitter to attack short-sellers betting that Tesla's share price will go down. He was responding to a tweet suggesting that short-sellers were \"freaking out\" about suspected problems on Tesla's production line. \"Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it.\" -- April 1, 2018. Some investors appeared to believe it. A day after the April Fool's Day prank, Tesla's share price fell 5.1 percent. \"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!\" -- Jan. 27, 2018. Musk's Boring Co sold flamethrowers and hats to raise funds to build underground tunnels for its hyperloop transportation project. \"I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.\" -- July 25, 2017. Musk was targeting Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who had downplayed Musk's warnings about the danger of artificial intelligence. \"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!\" -- June 6, 2017. In an interview with the New York Times in August 2018, Musk said he takes Ambien and was having problems sleeping because of stress from his job. \"The rumor that I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue\" -- March 12, 2015. Musk has said he wanted his company SpaceX to develop a rocket capable of an unpiloted trip to Mars in 2022, with a crewed flight two years later.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jonathan Stempel</p> <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Elon Musk is a prolific tweeter, and on Thursday, a judge will decide whether a Feb. 19 tweet Musk sent violated a 2018 fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>The SEC has said that Musk used Twitter to update investors on Tesla's production outlook without getting required approval from company lawyers.

Musk has said the tweet merely restated outlook he provided on a Jan. 30, 2019 conference call, when he said production \"may be on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.\" </p> <p></p> <p>\"Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!\" -- Oct. 4, 2018. Musk was attacking both the SEC and short-sellers by renaming the regulator just one week after being sued over the \"funding secured\" tweet. Twelve days after this tweet, he and Tesla reached their settlement with the SEC. </p> <p></p> <p>\"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" -- Aug. 7, 2018. The tweet that prompted the SEC lawsuit. Musk was not close to taking Tesla private, and had not lined up financing. Tesla's share price traded as much as 13.3 percent higher following the tweet, which occurred during market hours. Musk tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018 that Tesla would remain public. </p> <p></p> <p>\"They have about three weeks before their short position explodes\" -- June 17, 2018. Musk frequently uses Twitter to attack short-sellers betting that Tesla's share price will go down. He was responding to a tweet suggesting that short-sellers were \"freaking out\" about suspected problems on Tesla's production line.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it.\" -- April 1, 2018. Some investors appeared to believe it. A day after the April Fool's Day prank, Tesla's share price fell 5.1 percent.</p> <p></p> <p>\"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!\" -- Jan. 27, 2018. Musk's Boring Co sold flamethrowers and hats to raise funds to build underground tunnels for its hyperloop transportation project.</p> <p></p> <p>\"I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.\" -- July 25, 2017. Musk was targeting Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who had downplayed Musk's warnings about the danger of artificial intelligence.</p> <p></p> <p>\"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!\" -- June 6, 2017. In an interview with the New York Times in August 2018, Musk said he takes Ambien and was having problems sleeping because of stress from his job.</p> <p></p> <p>\"The rumor that I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue\" -- March 12, 2015. Musk has said he wanted his company SpaceX to develop a rocket capable of an unpiloted trip to Mars in 2022, with a crewed flight two years later. </p> <p></p>","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-sec-tweets-factbox/factbox-elon-musk-unabridged-on-twitter-idUSKCN1RG142","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:44:03Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Business News","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/businessNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"Hawaii residents return to new normal after epic volcano eruption","datePublished":"2019-04-04T10:52:32","datePublishedRaw":"April 4, 2019 / 10:52 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","author":"https://www.reuters.com/journalists/terray-sylvester","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190404&t=2&i=1373415985&r=LYNXNPEF330Y7","description":"For weeks on end last year, Darryl Clinton watched the Kilauea Volcano from a front-row seat on the deck of his friend's house in Kapoho on Hawaii's Big Island, only leaving after a \"lava bomb\" from an erupting ground fissure flew onto the porch and nearly sliced his foot off.","articleBody":"By Terray Sylvester KAPOHO, Hawaii (Reuters) - For weeks on end last year, Darryl Clinton watched the Kilauea Volcano from a front-row seat on the deck of his friend's house in Kapoho on Hawaii's Big Island, only leaving after a \"lava bomb\" from an erupting ground fissure flew onto the porch and nearly sliced his foot off. On Monday he drove back to live at the house where he was injured after the County of Hawaii announced it had opened a makeshift road into the area, nearly a year after the historic eruption of the Kilauea Volcano forced hundreds to evacuate and destroyed more than 700 structures. Clinton and his neighbors now occupy what Hawaiians call a \"kipuka,\" an area of land surrounded by a now-hardened lava flow. He and other newly returned residents say they moved back because they can live inexpensively in a benign climate with beautiful surroundings - even if it's under one of North America's most active volcanoes. \"I don't really want to be in the whole rat race thing, and I can escape that here,\" said Clinton, 58, who moved to Kapoho in 2006 with his family and built an off-the-grid house - not hooked up to utilities - and started a garden. Kilauea has now returned to \"normal,\" the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced on March 26. \"What actually happened is that, based on Kilauea Volcano's behavior over the past 8 months and its lack of eruptive activity, the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory lowered the Volcano Alert Level for Kilauea to NORMAL,\" USGS spokeswoman Janet Babb said in an email. NEW NORMAL It's a new normal for returning residents. Not all of them are looking forward to it. Pauline and Eddie McLaren were cleaning their house of soot left by brush fires. The couple also lived off the grid, getting by on a small pension and pasturing horses on their three-acre (1.21-hectare) lot. Life wasn't easy and they had planned to sell their home before last year's eruption. They think the property is almost worthless now. \"The bottom line is, we came back because we had nowhere else to go,\" Pauline, 78, said. \"Now I don't think we'll ever leave.\" The couple received $4,000 in rental assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $9,000 from the Small Business Administration to repair the pasture fences burned in the brush fires, she said. Pauline is not afraid of another eruption because she doesn't expect to be alive for the next one. \"Next stop: six feet,\" she quipped, pointing at the ground below her feet. PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGE Carrie Fischer, 59, says she and her husband Harald are happy to stay in their largely unscathed home in the new kipuka and she isn't worried about another eruption. \"It's funny, I'm not that worried about it happening again because we lived through it. There was so much warning before it happened,\" Fischer said. She says the main challenge is psychological; she tries not to think about the ridges of cooling lava that now surround her neighborhood. \"I try not to think that I can't get out easily.\" During the eruption, fountains of lava from some 22 ground fissures created molten ridges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) high, and in places cinder cones up to 50 feet (15 meters) high. When it rains the still-cooling lava ridges give off steam plumes. Ingrid Webb, 34, says she and her husband and four children are also delighted to be able to drive back to their 15-acre (6-hectare) organic farm. She doesn't know of anywhere else where she can re-create the life they have in the East Rift Zone, where the climate and soil are so conducive to the crops they grow. The main headache she says is access into the community on the makeshift road, which only residents can use for now - not repairmen, or farmworkers.

Brexit is now in mired in doubt, nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc. Supporters fear betrayal and opponents are pushing for another referendum. May, who has already delayed Brexit once, is now trying to find a way to get a divorce deal approved by courting opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who wants to agree a much closer post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU. \"The important thing now is that in any extension that we get from the EU, we have an absolute clarity that as soon as we've done the deal, we are able to bring that extension to an end,\" finance minister Philip Hammond told ITV. When asked if he was comfortable about a long extension, he said he was not comfortable about it, but that the defeat of May's deal on Friday, the very day that Britain was due to have left the EU, meant \"we are where we are.\" Corbyn, a veteran socialist campaigner whom May has repeatedly derided as unfit for office, said on Wednesday that she had not moved far enough in talks which continued, at a lower level, on Thursday. Labour's Brexit point man, Keir Starmer, and Corbyn's strategy chief, Seumas Milne, were seen entering the Cabinet Office with May's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Thursday. May's de-facto deputy, David Lidington, will also attend. The aim, May's spokesman said, was to have intensive discussions. A further meeting between May and Corbyn will happen when there is a reason for one, her spokesman said. Hammond said that if talks failed, the government would present some ideas from the discussions to parliament. Lawmakers may have to sacrifice some of their Easter holidays, the government said. The Brexit vote exposed deep fractures in British society, though the crisis it triggered has also shown a political system in dire need of reform. It is unclear how, when or if Britain will leave the EU. BREXIT CHAOS The chaos has raised fears of a disorderly exit that would shock the British economy, roil financial markets and even hurt global trade. The European Central Bank has warned that markets need to price in a no-deal Brexit. Concern about Brexit is slowing the German economy, leading top economic institutes to slash their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half on Thursday. The House of Commons on Wednesday approved legislation which would force May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a no-deal departure on April 12. \"If passed ... this bill would place a severe constraint on the government's ability to negotiate an extension,\" May's spokesman said. After more than two years of tortuous discussions about the minutiae of the separation, EU leaders are weary of London's failure to agree its own divorce and patience is wearing thin. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12 - the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut-off for avoiding the European Parliament elections. The EU is discussing different options: a delay until the end of the year, next Spring or the end of 2020 though in recent days discussions have focused mostly on a one year delay. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet residents who live along the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland during a visit to Dublin on Thursday to discuss Brexit to learn what impact any return of frontier checks would have on their lives. Merkel will use her trip to meet Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to consider the border situation and how to prevent a no-deal \"hard Brexit\". UBS Wealth Management said it was unlikely the parliamentary deadlock would be broken in the near term so a long extension to the divorce window, known as Article 50, was likely. \"Failure to secure the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days would result in a long extension to Article 50,\" UBS said. \"This extension will be granted by the EU27, with conditions.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Guy Faulconbridge, Elizabeth Piper and Andrew MacAskill</p> <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May's government and the opposition Labour Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over the divorce from the European Union. </p> <p>Brexit is now in mired in doubt, nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc.

Kudlow, speaking to reporters on Wednesday at an event organized by the Christian Science Monitor, said China had recognized problems for the first time during the talks that the United States has raised for years. Negotiations continued in Washington on Wednesday after meetings last week in Beijing, spearheaded by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. President Donald Trump will meet Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side in the talks, in the Oval Office at 4:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) on Thursday, the White House said. A date for a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could be announced as early as Thursday, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources, which would signal that a deal could be close. But the WSJ, citing an administration official, said discussions remained fluid and those plans could change. Asked about the potential for a meeting between the presidents, China's Foreign Ministry told a news briefing on Thursday that it had noted that Trump had repeatedly expressed his hope to meet with Xi. \"President Xi also looks forward to maintaining communication with President Trump in all kinds of ways,\" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said without elaborating. The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of two-way trade since July 2018. Trump has said he wants a \"great deal\" with China and has hinted that tariffs could remain in place for some time. Chinese commitments to increase purchases of American agricultural, energy and manufactured products are expected to be part of a final deal, and a person familiar with the talks said China would get about six years to meet those commitments, or until 2025. The deadline was reported earlier by Bloomberg, but Trump administration officials previously said that a six-year timeline for purchases exceeding $1 trillion had been under discussion. A final number for the amount of purchases has not been settled, the person said. Kudlow said Liu and his team would remain in Washington for three days and possibly longer. \"We're covering issues that have never really been covered before, including enforcement,\" Kudlow said, listing U.S. accusations that Beijing engages in intellectual property theft, forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies doing business in China, cyber hacking, tariffs and non-tariff barriers for commodity trading. \"All making good progress, all making good headway, but we're not there yet,\" he said about those areas. \"We hope this week to get closer.\" Kudlow said it was significant that China had \"acknowledged these problems for the first time. They were in denial.\" Those structural issues along with the way a potential deal would be enforced have been sticking points during months of talks between the world's two largest economies. Kudlow said on Wednesday that U.S. charges against Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd had generally not come up during trade talks. Kudlow also said no decisions had been made on tariffs on auto imports coming from top U.S. allies.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jeff Mason</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trade talks between the United States and China made \"good headway\" last week in Beijing and the two sides aim to bridge differences during talks that could extend beyond three days this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. </p> <p>Kudlow, speaking to reporters on Wednesday at an event organized by the Christian Science Monitor, said China had recognized problems for the first time during the talks that the United States has raised for years.</p> <p>Negotiations continued in Washington on Wednesday after meetings last week in Beijing, spearheaded by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p> <p>President Donald Trump will meet Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side in the talks, in the Oval Office at 4:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) on Thursday, the White House said.</p> <p>A date for a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could be announced as early as Thursday, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources, which would signal that a deal could be close.

The arrest, which legal experts not connected to the case described as highly rare for someone already released on bail, marks the fourth time that prosecutors have arrested the once-feted executive, a scandal that has rocked the global auto industry and shined a harsh light on Japan's judicial system. Tokyo prosecutors said Ghosn had caused Nissan Motor Co $5 million in losses over a 2-1/2-year period to July 2018, in breach of his legal duties to the company and with the goal of personal gain. The Kyodo news agency reported that the losses involved the shifting of funds through a dealer in Oman to the account of a company Ghosn effectively owned. The agency did not cite any sources. Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, called on the French government for help. \"I am innocent,\" Ghosn said in an interview aired on Thursday with French TV stations TF1 and LCI. \"I call on the French government to defend me, and to defend my rights as a citizen.\" It was not clear where the interview was recorded. France's finance minister said Ghosn must have the presumption of innocence and was getting consular protection. His lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said prosecutors wanted to silence Ghosn who on Wednesday tweeted plans to hold his first press conference on April 11. \"The intent of the prosecutors is to pressure Ghosn, and to stop him from speaking freely,\" Hironaka said, adding that access to what they saw as additional evidence was also a likely motive behind the latest arrest. The additional charge would likely prolong Ghosn's trial, which is expected to begin later this year, Hironaka said, adding that loss of access to Ghosn's trial-related documents could put his client at a disadvantage in fighting his case. Prosecutors confiscated Ghosn's mobile phone, documents, notebooks and diaries, he said, along with Ghosn's wife's passport and mobile phone. Hironaka said he would release a video statement Ghosn had planned to deliver at the April 11 news conference, without saying when. An official for the Tokyo prosecutors' office told reporters on Thursday that authorities feared Ghosn would destroy evidence. The official declined to comment when asked about the confiscation of Ghosn's wife's possessions. FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT CHARGES More than a dozen officials from the prosecutor's office had visited Ghosn's residence early on Thursday and asked him to submit to questioning, broadcaster NHK said. By late morning, Japanese media said he had been taken back to the detention center where he spent 108 days after being first arrested in November. Nissan said it could not comment on judicial decisions. Ghosn faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the financial crisis. Released on $9 million bail on March 6, the executive says he is the victim of a boardroom coup. Under Japanese law, prosecutors will be able to hold him for up to 22 days without charge. The fresh arrest opens up the possibility that he will be interrogated again without his lawyer present, as is the norm in Japan. Such procedures have focused much attention in the West on Japan's judicial system, which critics sometimes refer to as \"hostage justice\", because defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail. \"It's uncommon for someone to be re-arrested a month after being granted bail. In most cases, re-arrest would occur immediately following bail,\" said Nobuo Gohara, a lawyer who heads Gohara Compliance and Law Office, which is not involved in the Ghosn case. \"Multiple arrests suggest that the prosecutor may be concerned about their chances of winning a guilty verdict.\" INTERNAL INVESTIGATION Nissan late last year expanded its internal investigation into possible financial misconduct related to its business in the Middle East, India and elsewhere. Sources told Reuters this week that French automaker and Nissan partner Renault SA had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was chief executive. Evidence sent to French prosecutors showed that much of the cash was subsequently channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said. Ghosn's French lawyer has denied the allegations. Nissan had previously established its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Oman distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA). Ghosn's spokesman has said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Oman firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by Ghosn and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt, the spokesman said. Reuters has not been able to reach SBA for comment on the matter.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Tim Kelly and Naomi Tajitsu</p> <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Carlos Ghosn again on Thursday on suspicion the former Nissan boss had tried to enrich himself at the automaker's expense, in another dramatic twist that his lawyers said was an attempt to muzzle him.</p> <p>The arrest, which legal experts not connected to the case described as highly rare for someone already released on bail, marks the fourth time that prosecutors have arrested the once-feted executive, a scandal that has rocked the global auto industry and shined a harsh light on Japan's judicial system. </p> <p>Tokyo prosecutors said Ghosn had caused Nissan Motor Co $5 million in losses over a 2-1/2-year period to July 2018, in breach of his legal duties to the company and with the goal of personal gain.</p> <p>The Kyodo news agency reported that the losses involved the shifting of funds through a dealer in Oman to the account of a company Ghosn effectively owned.

But the Silicon Valley carmaker reaffirmed its guidance to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for its new Model 3 - which was recently made available for $35,000 - outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter. Tesla, whose delivery numbers missed analysts' expectations, said it had only delivered half of the quarter's numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter. \"Overall, the Street was expecting an apocalyptic quarter and Model 3 deliveries were better than feared by many,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who noted the overall number was \"clearly rocky.\" Lower deliveries in the first quarter had been expected, as Tesla shifted for the first time to delivering its new Model 3 to China and Europe in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America and after a $7,500 tax credit was cut in half at the end of 2018. On Wednesday, Tesla said net income in the quarter would be negatively impacted by the lower delivery and recent price cuts. The company warned in February that it would post a first-quarter loss. Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s in the quarter, falling short of analysts' estimates of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Tesla delivered a total of 63,000 vehicles, including 12,100 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. That was less than half the 27,550 Model S and Xs delivered in the fourth quarter. Analyst Ives called S and X numbers poor, with Tesla focused on Model 3. Total production fell 10.92 percent to 77,100 vehicles from 86,555 vehicles in fourth quarter. The company churned out 62,950 Model 3s, up from a total of 61,394 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla's growth strategy and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital. Musk has been engaged in a public battle with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla's production estimates and a judge will hear the case on Thursday. Although Tesla said in late February that it would soon begin selling its originally promised $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan to its North American customers, the change came too late to make a marked difference in its quarterly deliveries. NEW CHALLENGES Delivering its Model 3 to international markets posed new challenges for Tesla. Musk tweeted that the company encountered \"many unexpected challenges\" when Model 3s came through the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in early February. More recently, misprinted labels delayed Model 3s entering through Shanghai. The arrival of the Model 3 in Norway led to a surge in market share for Tesla in that country, with the car the biggest seller in Norway in March. Still, some analysts have questioned the sustainability of global demand as European rivals roll out competing electric vehicles. Too many vehicles in transit can put a strain on Tesla's working capital. Before Tesla's release, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that working capital could be tapped by as much as $800 million in the quarter due to such vehicles. Tesla said it ended the quarter with \"sufficient cash on hand.\" As the company strives to improve margins and post profit later in 2019, the company has laid off workers, including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs. It has since said it would keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models. Shares of Tesla closed up 2 percent on Wednesday to $291.81, before the announcement.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Alexandria Sage and Rama Venkat Raman</p> <p>SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Tesla Inc deliveries fell 31 percent in its first quarter as the electric car maker struggled with its first shipments of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China due to longer transit times.</p> <p>But the Silicon Valley carmaker reaffirmed its guidance to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for its new Model 3 - which was recently made available for $35,000 - outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.</p> <p>Tesla, whose delivery numbers missed analysts' expectations, said it had only delivered half of the quarter's numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter.

Johnson, Tim Hepher and Jason Neely ADDIS ABABA/SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Investigators will release on Thursday a keenly awaited report on the deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, Ethiopia's Transport Ministry said, giving the first official clues to the second crash of a new Boeing 737 MAX in five months. Some 35 nationalities were among the 157 passengers and crew who died when the nearly full plane crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in clear conditions. The March 10 disaster prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing's best-selling plane and scrutiny of its certification process. \"The 10:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) press conference is to present the preliminary report,\" Ethiopian Transport Ministry spokesman Musie Yehyies said. The report may shed light on how a piece of cockpit software came back to life after pilots initially switched it off as they tried to save the doomed jet, people familiar with the matter said, placing both technology and crew in the spotlight. Boeing said on Wednesday it successfully tested an update of the MCAS anti-stall software that is at the center of probes in both the Ethiopian crash and October's Lion Air accident in Indonesia that together killed 346 people. Boeing said its CEO Dennis Muilenburg joined the Wednesday test flight and that the flight crew performed different scenarios to test failure conditions. \"The software update worked as designed, and the pilots landed safely at Boeing Field\" near Seattle, the company said in a statement. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it is launching a new review of the 737 MAX. The Ethiopian-led investigation has begun piecing together details of flight 302, starting with faulty sensor data on take-off from Addis Ababa, questions over the Boeing 737 MAX's high speed and a nosedive coinciding with the software re-activation. The aircraft's high speed and initial climb suggests the engines were running at a higher than usual thrust, experts say. MCAS was designed to help prevent an aerodynamic stall by issuing commands to push the plane's nose lower. However, in both cases it is suspected of firing up in response to faulty airflow data from a single sensor designed to measure the \"angle of attack,\" a parameter needed to avoid stalling or losing lift. SENSOR PROBLEMS Echoing the fate of the Lion Air jet, initial evidence suggests the Ethiopian Airlines jet experienced sensor problems shortly after take-off, causing the MCAS software to begin lowering the nose to grab air under the wings. Unlike the Lion Air crew, who were flying at a time when pilots had been told little about the MCAS software, the Ethiopian crew used switches to turn the automatic system off but it later re-engaged, people familiar with the matter said. Although aircraft experts say MCAS cannot turn back on by itself, the report is expected to shed light on whether and why the crew chose to restore electrical power to the system at the risk of setting off more automated nose-down movements. Aerospace analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a blog post for Leeham News that pilots may have deliberately re-activated the system in order to make it easier to control the aircraft only to be overwhelmed by rapid counter-moves from MCAS. Investigators will also look at whether the crew carried out all necessary procedures, including a recommendation to stabilize the plane using the control system before turning the crucial software off. The pilots maneuvered the plane upwards at least two times before hitting the stabilizer cut-out switches to disable the system, one person familiar with the matter said. However, initial flight data indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a \"neutral\" attitude when pilots hit the cut-out switches, the person added, making the situation harder to manage. Cockpit procedures call for pilots to leave the MCAS system off for the rest of the flight once it has been disengaged. GLOBAL GROUNDING Safety experts stress the investigation is far from complete and most aviation disasters are caused by a unique combination of human and technical factors. In a statement, Boeing said: \"We urge caution against speculating and drawing conclusions on the findings prior to the release of the flight data and the preliminary report.\" The 737 MAX is Boeing's top-selling jet with almost 5,000 on order. Ethiopian Airlines is also in the midst of an expansion drive, while other 737 MAX customers and victims' families want answers, and potentially compensation. Boeing shares closed down 1.5 percent. They have lost more than 8.5 percent since the Ethiopian crash. Getting the planes flying again depends partly on the role that Boeing design features are found to have played in the crash, though investigators are also paying attention to airline operations, crew actions and regulatory measures. The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Bjoern Kjos, who is a former fighter pilot, said on Wednesday he tested the old MCAS flight control system versus the new one in a MAX simulator \"under a malfunction,\" and said it appears to be foolproof. The FAA's review of the MAX will be headed by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart and include experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities, including Canada.

However, in both cases it is suspected of firing up in response to faulty airflow data from a single sensor designed to measure the \"angle of attack,\" a parameter needed to avoid stalling or losing lift.</p> <p></p> <p>SENSOR PROBLEMS</p> <p>Echoing the fate of the Lion Air jet, initial evidence suggests the Ethiopian Airlines jet experienced sensor problems shortly after take-off, causing the MCAS software to begin lowering the nose to grab air under the wings.</p> <p>Unlike the Lion Air crew, who were flying at a time when pilots had been told little about the MCAS software, the Ethiopian crew used switches to turn the automatic system off but it later re-engaged, people familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>Although aircraft experts say MCAS cannot turn back on by itself, the report is expected to shed light on whether and why the crew chose to restore electrical power to the system at the risk of setting off more automated nose-down movements.</p> <p>Aerospace analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a blog post for Leeham News that pilots may have deliberately re-activated the system in order to make it easier to control the aircraft only to be overwhelmed by rapid counter-moves from MCAS.</p> <p>Investigators will also look at whether the crew carried out all necessary procedures, including a recommendation to stabilize the plane using the control system before turning the crucial software off.</p> <p>The pilots maneuvered the plane upwards at least two times before hitting the stabilizer cut-out switches to disable the system, one person familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>However, initial flight data indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a \"neutral\" attitude when pilots hit the cut-out switches, the person added, making the situation harder to manage. </p> <p>Cockpit procedures call for pilots to leave the MCAS system off for the rest of the flight once it has been disengaged. </p> <p></p> <p>GLOBAL GROUNDING</p> <p>Safety experts stress the investigation is far from complete and most aviation disasters are caused by a unique combination of human and technical factors. </p> <p>In a statement, Boeing said: \"We urge caution against speculating and drawing conclusions on the findings prior to the release of the flight data and the preliminary report.\"</p> <p>The 737 MAX is Boeing's top-selling jet with almost 5,000 on order. Ethiopian Airlines is also in the midst of an expansion drive, while other 737 MAX customers and victims' families want answers, and potentially compensation. </p> <p>Boeing shares closed down 1.5 percent. They have lost more than 8.5 percent since the Ethiopian crash. </p> <p>Getting the planes flying again depends partly on the role that Boeing design features are found to have played in the crash, though investigators are also paying attention to airline operations, crew actions and regulatory measures.</p> <p>The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Bjoern Kjos, who is a former fighter pilot, said on Wednesday he tested the old MCAS flight control system versus the new one in a MAX simulator \"under a malfunction,\" and said it appears to be foolproof.</p> <p>The FAA's review of the MAX will be headed by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart and include experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities, including Canada. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Canadian government said it will be a part of the review to ensure safety of the MAX.</p> <p></p> <p></p>","videoUrls":["https://vm.reuters.tv/3849e/305418_MEDIUM_ETHIOPIAN(305439_R21MP41500).mp4","https://vm.reuters.tv/3a753/uxwehweyp4t-1404k.mp4"],"url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane-software/ethiopia-to-issue-first-boeing-investigation-report-on-thursday-idUSKCN1RF0YU","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:44:07Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Business News","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/businessNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"Target raises minimum wage to $13 an hour in tight labor market","datePublished":"2019-04-04T12:05:28","datePublishedRaw":"April 4, 2019 / 12:05 PM / in 31 minutes","author":"https://www.reuters.com/journalists/nandita-bose","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190404&t=2&i=1373436829&r=LYNXNPEF3314F","description":"Target Corp will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12 currently, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart Inc to attract retail workers in a tight labor market.","articleBody":"By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12 currently, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart Inc to attract retail workers in a tight labor market. Minneapolis-based Target employs over 300,000 workers and runs 1,845 stores in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, grow its online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers' homes. Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. The wage increase will affect \"tens of thousands\" of employees, a Target spokeswoman said. Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage. Walmart, the world's largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays workers $11 an hour at entry-level. Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for the federal minimum wage to be raised. The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party's 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform. \"Croissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. \"Yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??\" Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March pays employees at least $15 an hour. In a blog post due to be published on Target's website on Thursday, the company's Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer tied the minimum wage hikes to the company's strong holiday performance, saying it \"made a big difference.\" In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season. \"We were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,\" Kremer said. It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay. Target's spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target's previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Nandita Bose</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12 currently, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart Inc to attract retail workers in a tight labor market.</p> <p>Minneapolis-based Target employs over 300,000 workers and runs 1,845 stores in the United States.

The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the EU last Friday but, nearly three years after it voted by 52 percent to 48 for Brexit in a referendum, it is still unclear how, when or even whether it will quit the bloc it joined in 1973. After her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by lawmakers, the Conservative prime minister invited Corbyn, a veteran socialist, to talks in parliament to try to plot a way out of the crisis. \"There hasn't been as much change as I expected,\" Corbyn, 69, said. \"The meeting was useful but inconclusive.\" Asked if May had accepted his preference for a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, he said: \"We did have a discussion about all of that.\" Corbyn is under pressure from some in his party not to agree a Brexit deal without ensuring that it can be confirmed or rejected in a new referendum that also offers the option to stay in the EU. He himself has said such a vote should be restricted to specific circumstances. \"I said: 'Look, this is a policy of our party that we would want to pursue the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or prevent leaving on a bad deal,'\" he said. \"There was no agreement reached on that.\" Talks will continue on Thursday. \"CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING\" A Downing Street spokesman said the meeting, which lasted an hour and 40 minutes, had been \"constructive, with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close\". \"We have agreed a program of work to ensure we deliver for the British people, protecting jobs and security,\" he added. May's overture to Corbyn, whose party has 245 out of 650 lawmakers, offers a possible way for her to secure a majority for an exit deal as she seeks a second short delay to Brexit. But some in the Labour Party have cast her gambit as a trap aimed at scaring her own lawmakers into backing the thrice-defeated deal, or as a way to extend responsibility for the difficulties of Brexit to the Labour Party. May said on Tuesday she would seek a delay that is \"as short as possible\" to the current Brexit date of April 12, having repeatedly said she did not want Britain to have to take part in European Parliament elections on May 23. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12 - the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut-off for avoiding the European Parliament elections. To secure a longer extension, the leaders have told May that she must present a credible way forward, and also sign up to those elections, something she is adamantly opposed to. But Britain could ask the EU for a long Brexit delay that gives the option to leave as soon as a divorce deal is approved by parliament, finance minister Philip Hammond indicated. If the talks with Labour fail, May will put different Brexit options for the future relationship to a vote in parliament, in the hope of finding a plan viable enough to present in Brussels. CONSERVATIVE ANGER May's last-ditch approach to Corbyn, who is loathed by many of her Conservatives and mocked by May herself as unfit to govern, provoked anger in her febrile party. Two junior ministers quit on Wednesday - one of them from the Brexit department. \"It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal - cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first - is better than 'no- deal',\" Nigel Adams said as he resigned as a minister for Wales. May turned to Labour after a hard core of Brexit supporters among her own Conservatives repeatedly rejected her divorce deal, saying it would leave Britain a 'vassal state'. Using a nickname that plays on May's reputed robotic inflexibility, one Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker told Reuters: \"The Maybot has gone haywire - we've got to find the 'off' switch.\" Corbyn, who voted against EU membership in a 1975 referendum, told May he wanted a customs union with the EU, access to its single market, and a guarantee of continued observance of European regulations - as a minimum on the environment, and consumer and workers’ rights. Many supporters want the party to throw its weight behind a second referendum. But some Labour lawmakers who represent areas that voted strongly to leave the EU not only reject this but also fear that such a 'soft' Brexit would be seen as a betrayal. Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said the government would accept a soft Brexit if parliament voted for it. Britain could one day review its membership of a possible post-Brexit customs union with the European Union, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told the BBC. \"If we decided, in some considerable years time that we wanted to review our membership of any such customs union if we signed it - and I'm not saying we will - that's a matter for negotiation and discussion,\" Cox said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James</p> <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Theresa May had not moved far enough in a first round of crisis talks aimed at breaking the domestic deadlock over Britain's exit from the European Union.</p> <p>The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the EU last Friday but, nearly three years after it voted by 52 percent to 48 for Brexit in a referendum, it is still unclear how, when or even whether it will quit the bloc it joined in 1973.</p> <p>After her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by lawmakers, the Conservative prime minister invited Corbyn, a veteran socialist, to talks in parliament to try to plot a way out of the crisis.</p> <p>\"There hasn't been as much change as I expected,\" Corbyn, 69, said. \"The meeting was useful but inconclusive.\"</p> <p>Asked if May had accepted his preference for a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, he said: \"We did have a discussion about all of that.\"</p> <p>Corbyn is under pressure from some in his party not to agree a Brexit deal without ensuring that it can be confirmed or rejected in a new referendum that also offers the option to stay in the EU.

We face unprecedented challenges - challenges no one nation can face alone,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Saying \"time is running out,\" Stoltenberg also called on Russia to return to compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, from which U.S. President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States this summer. \"NATO has no intention of deploying land-based nuclear missiles in Europe,\" Stoltenberg said. \"But NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence.\" Stoltenberg used his speech to give an impassioned defense of the 70-year-old Western alliance, a partnership he called \"the most successful alliance in history,\" which has often been derided by Trump since he took office in 2017. Members of Congress, who greeted Stoltenberg with repeated cheers and standing ovations, said they viewed his address to the joint meeting of the House of Representatives and Senate as a chance to reaffirm the American commitment to the NATO alliance. Stoltenberg was the first leader of an international organization and the first Norwegian to be accorded the rare honor of such an address. 'GOOD FOR THE UNITED STATES' \"NATO has been good for Europe, but NATO has also been good for the United States,\" Stoltenberg said. The invitation to Stoltenberg to speak as the alliance celebrates its 70th anniversary in Washington was widely seen as a way to send a message to Trump about strong bipartisan support for NATO. \"The strength of a nation is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers, but also by the number of its friends,\" Stoltenberg added. \"And through NATO the United States has more friends and allies than any other power. This has made the United States stronger, safer and more secure.\" The Senate is due to vote later this year on whether North Macedonia can become NATO's 30th member. Trump has ruffled feathers among European allies by repeatedly saying NATO nations need to pay more for their militaries and ease the burden on the United States. Earlier this year, before inviting Stoltenberg to Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation of her fellow Democrats to Brussels, where they sought to reassure European allies that differences over Trump's policies were mere \"family squabbles\" and that transatlantic ties remained strong.

Stoltenberg met on Tuesday with Trump, who said his pressure on NATO nations to pay more for their defense is leading to tens of billions of dollars more in contributions, but the allies may need to boost their budgets even more.

The \"Deter Act\" is the latest effort by U.S. lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior, from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria's civil war to attempts to influence U.S. elections. The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican. They offered a similar measure last year, when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate's Republican leaders, who have close ties to President Donald Trump. Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia, although sometimes reluctantly. Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019, given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats, who are less reluctant than Trump's fellow Republicans to push back against the White House. According to details of the legislation, first reported by Reuters, it would require the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to determine, within 30 days of any federal election, whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government, had engaged in election interference. If the DNI found such interference occurred, the act would require, among other things, that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on, among others, Russian banks and energy companies. The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks: Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank. It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt, Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia's government. The sanctions would include blocking - freezing without seizing - any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction, including senior Russian political figures and business leaders. Russia denies trying to influence U.S. elections. But U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House. An investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election, according to a summary released by U.S. Attorney General William Barr last month. The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U.S. intelligence has identified China, Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats. It also asks that Trump's administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U.S. elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern. The senators timed the bill's release to come after the end of Mueller's investigation, which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump's presidency, and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the NATO alliance, who has focused on the threat posed by Russia.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Patricia Zengerle</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U.S. elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking, energy and defense industries and sovereign debt.</p> <p>The \"Deter Act\" is the latest effort by U.S. lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior, from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria's civil war to attempts to influence U.S. elections.</p> <p>The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican.

Kimberley Sue Endecott, 35, and Ugandan driver Jean Paul were on a game drive in Queen Elizabeth National Park when four gunmen ambushed their vehicle on Tuesday evening, a police statement said. Various illegal groups from Somali Islamists to Congolese-based rebels sometimes operate in Uganda, but the kidnappers' identity was not known. An elderly couple also at the scene were not taken and raised the alarm. \"I suspect the kidnappers left them because they were elderly. They took all their possessions,\" said Ugandan government spokesman Ofwono Opondo. Califonia-based Endecott and the couple, whose relationship was unclear, entered Uganda on March 29 and flew the next day to the park in the country's southwest, the spokesman added. The U.S. embassy in Kampala had no extra information to offer. \"We take seriously any threats against U.S. citizens abroad. Security forces are responding to the incident,\" it said in a statement. The Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab has carried out attacks in Uganda in the past, but has never been known to kidnap anyone for ransom there. The park, Uganda's most visited, is located about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of the capital Kampala, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is home to many fragmented rebel groups. Police said the kidnapping appeared financially motivated, since the group quickly made a demand using Endecott's mobile. \"The joint security teams have cut off all exit areas on the border between Uganda and the DRC in search of the victims,\" the police statement added, warning the group may still be in the park. In 1999, an American couple, four Britons and two New Zealanders were killed along with four Ugandan guides when their group was ambushed by gunmen in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Survivors said the killers appeared to be Congo-based Hutu rebels.

The legislation, put forward by opposition Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, was rushed through all of its stages in the House of Commons in less than six hours. It was approved at the final stage by 313 votes to 312. It now has to pass the upper chamber, the House of Lords. May said on Tuesday she would seek another short extension to Brexit beyond April 12, in order to try and work with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to get her thrice-rejected Brexit deal approved by parliament. Cooper said the legislation was still needed to set out a clear process for how decisions are taken over the length of any extension. The bill requires May to get parliament's approval for the detail of any delay and allows lawmakers to propose a different length of extension. \"Perhaps crucially it would demonstrate to the EU parliamentary support for what the prime minister is asking for,\" she told parliament during the debate on the legislation. Any further delay to Britain's exit would need unanimous approval from EU leaders. To avoid an abrupt no-deal Brexit on April 12, May must present a summit of EU leaders next Wednesday with a plausible strategy to win approval in parliament for the Withdrawal Agreement that she negotiated with Brussels. May has said that if she cannot agree a unified approach with Corbyn, then the government would come up with a number of options on the future relationship with the EU and put them to parliament in a series of votes. The legislation was pushed through as part of a process which has seen lawmakers seize control of parliamentary time in order to influence the way forward on Brexit. It is very unusual for legislation which is not proposed by or supported by the government to be passed by parliament. The government said there were many flaws with the legislation, including the lack of time available for all the steps it sets out, and had concerns about the precedent it set. Pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker Bill Cash described it as \"a constitutional revolution\". \"This is a grave moment in our constitutional history. I think the Bill is reprehensible ... I think it is a disgrace that it was brought in,\" he told parliament ahead of the votes. It was unclear when the legislation would be debated in the House of Lords, where legislation usually passes more slowly and opponents could seek to filibuster it, but it could be as soon as Thursday. Conservative lawmaker Oliver Letwin, who was also involved in putting forward the legislation, said earlier on Wednesday there was \"overwhelming support in the House of Lords\" for it and he anticipated it would pass through the Lords rapidly. \"The House of Lords has in fact already passed a motion which provides for the expeditious consideration of exactly this form of bill,\" he said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Kylie MacLellan and William James</p> <p>LONDON (Reuters) - The lower house of the British parliament on Wednesday approved legislation which would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a potentially disorderly departure on April 12 without a deal.</p> <p>The legislation, put forward by opposition Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, was rushed through all of its stages in the House of Commons in less than six hours.

In a speech to a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump twice alluded to the allegations from two women that are hanging over Biden as he weighs whether to enter the contest to become the Democratic candidate in November 2020 presidential elections. A former Nevada state legislator last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event, and a Connecticut woman said Biden rubbed noses with her at a 2009 event. Biden has said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately, and his defenders have said he is known for hugging and being physically affectionate. In wide-ranging remarks that meandered for more than 80 minutes but often circled back to the 2020 race, Biden was the only potential rival Trump mentioned by name - a sign that he would view Biden as a strong challenger, were he to enter and win the Democratic race. Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama and had a long career in the Senate before that. He had been expected to announce his bid for the Democratic primary race this month and has led the large field of Democratic hopefuls in opinion polls. Trump told the dinner, which raised $23 million for Republicans running for the House of Representatives, a story about wanting to kiss a general he met in Iraq who had promised an expedient end to a campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria. \"I said, 'General: come here and give me a kiss.' I felt like Joe Biden,\" Trump said, drawing laughter and applause. Earlier, he told the crowd - which was dotted with members of the House - that they would be \"going into the war with some socialists\" in the next election. \"It looks like the only non-, sort of, heavy socialist is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists,\" Trump said. One of Biden's accusers has been a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has already entered the Democratic primary race, and whose views are to the left of Biden. \"I was going to call him - I don't know him well - I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? You having a good time?\" Trump said. Trump struggled during his 2016 run for office with multiple accusations of unwanted sexual contact from women, particularly after videotaped remarks emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. Biden, while campaigning for Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, had said he would like to take Trump \"behind the gym\" to beat him up for the comments.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Roberta Rampton</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took a shot on Tuesday at former Vice President Joe Biden, a possible Democratic rival in the 2020 race for the White House, mocking him over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women.</p> <p>In a speech to a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump twice alluded to the allegations from two women that are hanging over Biden as he weighs whether to enter the contest to become the Democratic candidate in November 2020 presidential elections.</p> <p>A former Nevada state legislator last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event, and a Connecticut woman said Biden rubbed noses with her at a 2009 event.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller's unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon. Nadler has not yet exercised that authority, with the timing of any such move uncertain. The committee vote was 24-17 along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Trump's fellow Republicans opposed. Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, issued a four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election. Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods. In addition to Bannon, the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson. They are among 81 people, agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates. Nadler's panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline. Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign. Nadler said he would work with Barr \"for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials\" and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material. \"But if that doesn't work out in a very short order, we will issue the subpoenas,\" Nadler added. \"... The committee must see everything.\" The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government's third branch - the judiciary. Representative Doug Collins, the committee's top Republican, said Democrats are \"desperate for dirt on this president.\" \"This is reckless. It's irresponsible. And it's disingenuous,\" Collins said. \"It's also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing: making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy.\" It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents. It could ignore a subpoena, running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress, and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle. INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTION In another development, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Trump critic Adam Schiff, is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump's inaugural committee. Citing people familiar with the request, the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than $100 million. The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters. Barr's March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller's \"principal conclusions\" said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Moscow denied election interference. Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump. Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report. \"If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge - not the president or his political appointee - to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record,\" Nadler said. Trump ally Lindsey Graham, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that the House panel's demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was \"dangerous and ridiculous.\" The Justice Department declined comment. Priebus declined to comment. A lawyer for Priebus, Bannon and McGahn, as well as a Bannon spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries. Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge's permission to get access to Mueller's grand jury material, which is protected under federal law. Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far. Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well, noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report's release to Congress.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By David Morgan</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on Russia's role in the 2016 election, moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump's administration.</p> <p>The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller's unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon.</p> <p>Nadler has not yet exercised that authority, with the timing of any such move uncertain.

Voters in the third-largest U.S. city on Tuesday elected Lori Lightfoot, who has never held office, in a runoff election. She easily defeated long-time local politician and a fellow black woman, Toni Preckwinkle, 72, to become the city's 56th mayor. Chicago has now become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor, and an openly gay woman as well. The 56-year-old Lightfoot is also the latest in a wave of political newcomers to win major elections around the globe as voters upend the status quo, propelling anti-establishment candidates to power. She will now take over a city where politics is a blood sport and where corruption has swirled in and around City Hall for generations. But Chicagoans are ready for a change, Lightfoot said on the campaign trail, promising to support mayoral term limits, reforms that would ban elected officials from profiting from their governmental positions and strengthen worker compensation oversight. \"They want a break from the corrupt political machine that has held back the aspirations of so many people,\" Lightfoot said during a debate last week. \"They want a government that is responsive to them and that has integrity.\" The city got its reputation as a well-oiled political machine from the way Richard J. Daley, one of the last big-city \"bosses,\" ran the city from 1955 to 1976 with help from armies of patronage workers and crooked city council members. Thirteen years later, his son Richard M. Daley became mayor and for the next 22 years, he ran the city as the powerful political machinery churned in the background. \"It's refreshing to see somebody who is different, hopefully,\" said Andrew Tabor, 61, a consultant who has lived in Chicago his entire life. Tabor recalled an incident from \"years ago\" when the so-called machine allegedly sent a message to a childhood friend's father who had political connections. \"They blew up his car. I don't know who he was not playing nice with, but someone blew up his car. That's the machine right there,\" Tabor said sitting in the living room of his home on the north side days before the historic vote. NOT PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH? Lightfoot has held several positions in and out of government. She was an assistant United States attorney, a senior equity partner at Mayer Brown LLP and, most notably, the president of the Chicago Police Board, an independent civilian panel. Some on the left, including Preckwinkle, criticized her as not being progressive enough, noting she made millions as a corporate lawyer representing corporate clients. She and Preckwinckle earned spots on the runoff ballot after they garnered the most votes among 14 candidates, including Richard M. Daley's younger brother Bill, in a February election. Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel, who announced in September he was not seeking a third term as mayor. Voters saw Lightfoot as the anti-establishment choice compared with Preckwinkle, who was a city council member, or alderman, for almost 20 years before becoming Cook County board president in 2010. \"Lightfoot will bring more change because Preckwinkle is connected to the old-boys club, the establishment,\" said retired mailman Gary Muckle, 77, after voting for Lightfoot this weekend at a polling place on the city's north side. \"We will have to see what happens now. Lightfoot is not beholden to anyone,\" he said. Lightfoot will also face a raft of thorny problems such as reforms to the police department, rampant gangs and violent crime and a spiraling budget deficit fueled by escalating pensions. Emanuel leaves as corruption continues to seep throughout city hall. Just this year, Alderman Ed Burke, a long-time political powerhouse in Chicago, was charged with extortion, Alderman Willie Cochran pleaded guilty to wire fraud and it was revealed Alderman Danny Solis was recently under investigation for corruption. Burke, who has been an alderman for 50 years, won re-election in February. In all, federal prosecutors racked up 246 public corruption convictions in the Northern Illinois District, which includes Chicago, from 2010 to 2017. That is 80 percent more than in the Southern District of New York, located in Manhattan, according to a report from the Department of Political Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. \"The race turned on reform of Chicago politics and moving towards a new Chicago,\" said Dick Simpson, a professor in the department, who studies Chicago politics, noting that 33 city council members have gone to jail over the last four decades. \"There seems to be a desire to make reforms so that the continuing pattern of corruption ... would change permanently,\" said Simpson, a former city council member.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Brendan O'Brien</p> <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago, known for its machine politics and corruption, woke up Wednesday to voters choosing an anti-establishment candidate who may shake up a city that made history by electing its first African-American woman for mayor. </p> <p>Voters in the third-largest U.S. city on Tuesday elected Lori Lightfoot, who has never held office, in a runoff election.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12 - the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut-off for avoiding the European Parliament elections. Hammond said there did not have to be a vote on a deal by the April 10 EU Council summit and that while there would be big advantages to doing that it was probably unlikely. \"The important thing now is that in any extension that we get from the EU, we have an absolute clarity that as soon as we've done the deal, we are able to bring that extension to an end,\" Hammond told ITV. \"So it's less about the nominal length of time of the extension and more about the mechanism for bringing it to an end once the deal is done,\" he said. \"That would be our expectation.\" When asked if he was comfortable about a long extension, he said he was not comfortable about it but that the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's deal meant \"we are where we are.\" Hammond said he hoped talks with the opposition Labour Party would very quickly allow an understanding of whether a cross-party deal was viable. \"Some kind of customs arrangement is clearly going to be a part of the future structure,\" Hammond said. He said that if talks with Labour failed, the government would try to take ideas from the discussions and present them to parliament. If a deal was passed by the eve of the May elections, then they could be pulled, Hammond said. The Sun newspaper said May would seek a delay of nine months. As many as 15 ministers in May's government are on the edge of resigning over her Brexit talks with the opposition Labour Party, The Sun reported.

Prosecutors had wanted U.S. Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley in Boston to go further and prohibit the 12 wealthy parents who appeared before her from talking about the case with their children without a lawyer present. But while Kelley told the parents to consider seeking legal advice before discussing the case with their children to avoid exposing themselves to obstruction of justice charges, she said she did not think the prosecution's proposed conditions on parental communications could work. \"I just don't think that's realistic,\" Kelley said. \"Desperate Housewives\" star Huffman and \"Full House\" actor Loughlin said little during the hearing other than to say that they understood the charges prosecutors brought against them. They are among 50 people, including several college athletics coaches, charged with participating in fraud and bribery schemes. Prosecutors said the schemes involved cheating on college entrance exams and paying $25 million in bribes to help the wealthy parents' children gain admission at well-known universities including Yale and the University of Southern California (USC). Some of the 33 parents charged in the scheme have begun plea negotiations with prosecutors. On Wednesday, packaged food entrepreneur Peter Sartorio became the first to reveal he plans to plead guilty. Two others said they were also in plea talks. Prosecutors say the scheme was overseen by California college admissions consultant William \"Rick\" Singer, who has admitted to facilitating the cheating scam and bribing coaches to present the parents' children as fake athletic recruits. Loughlin walked into the courthouse past a group fans yelling \"Lori, we love you,\" and left smiling. Huffman exited the court holding her brother's hand. Prosecutors allege that Loughlin and her husband, Los Angeles fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, agreed to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC's crew team, even though they did not row competitively. Huffman, who is married to the actor William H. Macy, is accused of making a $15,000 contribution to Singer's foundation in exchange for having an associate of Singer's in 2017 secretly correct her daughter's answers on an SAT college entrance exam at a test center that prosecutors say Singer \"controlled.\" Huffman later made arrangements to engage in the scheme again on her younger daughter's behalf before deciding not to, prosecutors said. Sartorio, who is expected to plead guilty later this month, similarly paid $15,000 to have his daughter's ACT exam corrected by Singer's associate, prosecutors said. Prosecutors have not charged any applicants, and said that in some cases the parents involved took steps to try to prevent their children from realizing they were benefiting from fraud.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Nate Raymond</p> <p>BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday warned parents charged in the largest college admissions scandal in U.S. history, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, to be careful discussing the case with their children, who are potential witnesses.</p> <p>Prosecutors had wanted U.S. Magistrate Judge M.

A former federal prosecutor, Lightfoot won 74 percent of the vote with nearly all precincts counted compared with 26 percent for Preckwinkle, a long-time local politician, to become Chicago's 56th mayor. Lightfoot, 56, who will also become the first openly gay mayor of the third-largest U.S. city, appealed to voters who are tired of politics as usual. She has never held political office, while Preckwinkle, 72, was a city councilwoman for almost 20 years before becoming Cook County board president in 2010. \"You did more than make history. You created a movement for change,\" Lightfoot told hundreds of supporters at her election night party, promising to end corruption and make the city's streets safe again. \"We can and will remake Chicago.\" The runoff between two African-American women was a rarity in the United States, where only 6 percent of mayors in the 200 largest U.S. cities are women of color, according to the Reflective Democracy Campaign. Lightfoot and Preckwinkle, both Democrats, earned spots on the ballot in the runoff after they garnered the most votes among 14 candidates in a February election. Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel, who did not seek a third term. \"She brings fresh air and is someone I can trust,\" Shisha Amabel, a 72-year-old retired social worker who joined supporters at Lightfoot's celebration at a Michigan Avenue hotel. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker alluded to former U.S. President Barack Obama, once an Illinois senator, in offering his congratulations. \"In a city that serves as the hometown for many Black American politicians who have made history, there is another political first,\" Booker said on Twitter. SAGGING FINANCES AND POLICE REFORM Lightfoot, the former president of independent civilian body the Chicago Police Board, will inherit massive fiscal challenges including a $28 billion unfunded liability for the city's four retirement systems and escalating annual pension contributions that will top $2 billion in 2023. A projected $252 million budget deficit for fiscal 2020, which begins Jan. 1, awaits the new mayor, along with expired or expiring labor contracts with police, firefighter and public school teacher unions. Neither candidate disclosed detailed plans to shore up the city's sagging finances. In debates, Lightfoot, a former corporate lawyer, said the city has to demonstrate it can be a \"better fiscal steward\" before it seeks more revenue. Lightfoot will take over a city ranked as one of the nation's most violent. Homicides in Chicago declined by more than a quarter in 2018 from its five-year high of 769 in 2016. But less than one out of five murders were solved in Chicago in the first half of 2018, according to local media. She will be expected to deliver on a campaign promise to reform the police department currently under court-appointed oversight to address a 2017 Justice Department finding of widespread excessive force and racial bias by officers. On day one, Lightfoot will also have to find a way to ease tension between the police department and state's attorney after prosecutors decided to drop charges against actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of staging a hate crime attack. Preckwinkle offered support. \"Not long ago, two African-American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable,\" she said. \"While it may be true that we took different paths to get here, tonight is about the path forward.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Brendan O'Brien and Karen Pierog</p> <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lori Lightfoot, a political newcomer, was elected the first black female mayor of Chicago on Tuesday, defeating opponent Toni Preckwinkle by a landslide in a runoff to take over a city struggling with crime and weak finances.</p> <p>A former federal prosecutor, Lightfoot won 74 percent of the vote with nearly all precincts counted compared with 26 percent for Preckwinkle, a long-time local politician, to become Chicago's 56th mayor. </p> <p>Lightfoot, 56, who will also become the first openly gay mayor of the third-largest U.S. city, appealed to voters who are tired of politics as usual.

Tricia Newbold, a White House security adviser, told Democrats in Congress that clearances were initially denied to dozens of administration officials because of concerns over possible foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems or drug abuse. She said President Donald Trump's former White House personnel security director, Carl Kline, personally overruled the career officials' judgments in the cases of two senior officials. Newbold's allegations were laid out in a letter sent to the White House on Monday and released by Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. \"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security,” his letter quoted Newbold as telling his committee. \"I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office.\" Cummings said he plans to subpoena Kline and warned that more subpoenas would be issued if the White House does not provide requested documents. In his letter to the White House, Cummings referred to three unnamed \"senior White House officials\" whose security clearance cases are addressed in some detail by Newbold. Two sources familiar with the information obtained by the Oversight Committee said two of those three senior officials are Ivanka Trump and Kushner, her husband. Asked about the whistleblower's assertions, Kushner said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he had complied with various investigations. \"I disclosed all of my holdings for the Office of Government Ethics, and what I did with them is they told me what to divest, what to keep, what rules to follow. We followed all that,\" Kushner said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House committee, issued a statement calling the letter a \"partisan attack\" that was \"an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants.\" Cummings said Newbold, a manager in the White House personnel security office, said she was targeted for retaliation after declining to approve applications based on national security protocols. \"I'm terrified of going back. I know that this will not be perceived in favor of my intentions, which is to bring back the integrity of the office,\" she is quoted as saying in the letter Cummings sent to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. Separately, the House Judiciary Committee said on Monday that it will this week issue subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Muller's full report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Attorney General William Barr issued a summary of Mueller's findings to Congress on March 24, saying the special counsel did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia. Mueller left unresolved the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the probe, and Barr concluded the evidence was insufficient to charge the president. Barr has said he will issue a redacted copy of Mueller's full report by mid-April, but Democrats want it without redactions and have demanded it be given to them this week. The new round of subpoenas signals increased pressure from Democrats on the Republican Trump White House. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letters. The Department of Justice declined to comment about the request from the Judiciary Committee. 'SIGNIFICANT DISQUALIFYING FACTORS' Cummings' memo on White House security clearances said career officials, including Newbold, initially rejected the application from \"Senior White House official 1\" after a background investigation revealed \"significant disqualifying factors,\" including \"foreign influence\" and \"personal conduct.\" The memo said Kline overruled the career officials' judgments, saying the activities that concerned security officials \"occurred prior to federal service.\" It also said Newbold told congressional investigators that a second person, referred to as \"senior White House Official 2\" was the subject of a 14-page memo laying out \"multiple disqualifiers\" including foreign influence and outside activities. Kline also approved a clearance for that unnamed official. Newbold told congressional investigators that in a third case she was pressured by Kline to reverse a recommendation that the clearance application be rejected. Newbold refused, and the third official ultimately left the White House, the Democrats' memo said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Ginger Gibson and Mark Hosenball</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House whistleblower has said the Trump administration overruled security experts to give questionable security clearances to more than two dozen people, including the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p> <p>Tricia Newbold, a White House security adviser, told Democrats in Congress that clearances were initially denied to dozens of administration officials because of concerns over possible foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems or drug abuse.</p> <p>She said President Donald Trump's former White House personnel security director, Carl Kline, personally overruled the career officials' judgments in the cases of two senior officials. </p> <p>Newbold's allegations were laid out in a letter sent to the White House on Monday and released by Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. </p> <p>\"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security,” his letter quoted Newbold as telling his committee. \"I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office.\"</p> <p>Cummings said he plans to subpoena Kline and warned that more subpoenas would be issued if the White House does not provide requested documents.</p> <p>In his letter to the White House, Cummings referred to three unnamed \"senior White House officials\" whose security clearance cases are addressed in some detail by Newbold. </p> <p>Two sources familiar with the information obtained by the Oversight Committee said two of those three senior officials are Ivanka Trump and Kushner, her husband.</p> <p>Asked about the whistleblower's assertions, Kushner said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he had complied with various investigations.</p> <p>\"I disclosed all of my holdings for the Office of Government Ethics, and what I did with them is they told me what to divest, what to keep, what rules to follow.

That has upset big movie chains, which refuse to show Netflix films and want a longer \"window\" of time to play films exclusively. The issue of how Netflix fits into, or threatens, the theater business dominated a press conference on Tuesday at CinemaCon, the theater industry trade show. \"All of your questions from the first 17 minutes or whatever are about Netflix,\" grumbled John Fithian, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners.

He also said Netflix had helped revive interest in documentaries, which had helped draw people to theaters to see them.

Chu said his film would not have had as big an impact if it had debuted on a streaming service. Some members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the group that hands out the Oscars, have been debating whether films must play in theaters for a specific length of time to compete for the awards, which could exclude Netflix or force the company to agree to longer exclusive theatrical runs. Hollywood publication Variety reported on Tuesday that the Department of Justice had weighed in on the issue. Antitrust chief Makan Delrahim sent a letter to the academy warning that any changes that limited eligibility for the industry's highest honors \"may raise antitrust concerns,\" according to Variety.

The United States is at a crossroads in a years-long standoff with Turkey, a NATO ally, after failing to persuade President Tayyip Erdogan that buying the Russian air defense system would compromise the security of the F-35, the most modern fighter in the U.S. arsenal. The standoff escalated on Monday as the Pentagon announced it suspended delivery of equipment related to the F-35 \"pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400.\" The aircraft is made by Lockheed Martin Corp. If the Pentagon takes the next step and removes Turkey from the F-35 program, it would be the most serious crisis in the relationship between the two allies in decades. Shanahan expressed optimism that both countries would find a way out of the crisis by convincing Turkey to purchase the Patriot air defense system instead of the S-400s. \"I expect we'll solve the problem so that they have the right defense equipment in terms of Patriots and F-35s,\" Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon. The Patriot is made by Raytheon Co. Shanahan added that he expected the United States to ultimately deliver F-35s currently at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona to Turkey, after resolving the dispute. Turkish pilots are receiving training on two aircraft at the base. America's top commander in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti, was more cautious, saying he thought there was still \"some possibility we can work this thing out.\" He stopped short of predicting a positive outcome. \"We're going to keep working (on) it until we know that it's just not possible,\" Scaparrotti told a small group of reporters. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also told reporters separately that he wasn't giving up on Ankara. DOWNWARD SPIRAL The disagreement over the F-35 and the S-400 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey, including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria. Scaparrotti warned that if Turkey didn't change course, the ties would continue to deteriorate and pose a challenge for NATO, with the presence of Russian defense systems inside the alliance. \"I'm not suggesting that Turkey can't be trusted. But I am saying that you do take another risk ... with what is probably our most sensitive technology,\" he said. A senior U.S. State Department official said that while the NATO alliance was \"strong and unified,\" U.S. tensions with Turkey over its S-400 purchase plans were likely to loom large over a NATO meeting of foreign ministers in Washington this week. \"We have very serious concerns about its stated plans to proceed with the acquisition of the S-400 missile defense system and there will be potential consequences, within sanctions law and the F-35 program if they continue,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Turkey could face sanctions under a U.S. law known as Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Turkey's lira currency dropped nearly 3 percent on Tuesday after the U.S. halt of the delivery and sanctions warning.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Tuesday said he expected to resolve a dispute with Turkey over its planned purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system, a day after the Pentagon halted delivery of equipment related to F-35 fighter jets to Ankara.</p> <p>The United States is at a crossroads in a years-long standoff with Turkey, a NATO ally, after failing to persuade President Tayyip Erdogan that buying the Russian air defense system would compromise the security of the F-35, the most modern fighter in the U.S. arsenal. </p> <p>The standoff escalated on Monday as the Pentagon announced it suspended delivery of equipment related to the F-35 \"pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400.\" The aircraft is made by Lockheed Martin Corp.</p> <p>If the Pentagon takes the next step and removes Turkey from the F-35 program, it would be the most serious crisis in the relationship between the two allies in decades.</p> <p>Shanahan expressed optimism that both countries would find a way out of the crisis by convincing Turkey to purchase the Patriot air defense system instead of the S-400s.</p> <p>\"I expect we'll solve the problem so that they have the right defense equipment in terms of Patriots and F-35s,\" Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon.

In a letter bit.ly/2CUDMcW to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, prosecutors and the country's top civil rights law enforcement official said they had evidence the state was violating prisoners' Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. \"We have reasonable cause to believe that Alabama routinely violates the constitutional rights of prisoners housed in the Alabama's prisons by failing to protect them from prisoner-on-prisoner violence and prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse, and by failing to provide safe conditions,\" the letter said. The review looked into prisons housing only male inmates. The letter, which cited overcrowding and \"serious deficiencies\" in staffing levels and supervision, ordered the prison system to correct the problems within 49 days or the state could face a federal civil rights lawsuit. The Justice Department said it also had the option of having U.S. Attorney General William Barr intervene in related private lawsuits against the state prison system. The letter was signed by Eric Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. attorneys for the southern, northern and middle districts of Alabama. The investigation was first initiated in October 2016, at the tail end of the Obama administration, and before Jeff Sessions, who is from Alabama, became the attorney general under President Donald Trump in early 2017, the department said. The Alabama governor acknowledged the Justice Department's findings and said the state's Department of Corrections had been actively working to fix the issues. The department \"has identified many of the same areas of concern that we have discussed publicly for some time,” Ivey said in a statement on her official website. “Over the coming months, my administration will be working closely with DOJ to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety.\" The state's Department of Corrections had being working to bolster the hiring and retention of correctional officers, to prevent prisoners from sneaking contraband into its facilities, and was replacing outdated prisons, the governor said.

(Reuters) - Attorney Michael Avenatti made a brief appearance in federal court in California on Monday, proclaiming his innocence on the courthouse steps as he was jeered by onlookers. Avenatti, best known for representing pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in her legal battles with U.S. President Donald Trump, did not enter a plea to fraud and embezzlement charges lodged against him in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. He is charged in a separate federal indictment in New York with what prosecutors said was an attempt to \"shake down\" Nike Inc for more than $20 million. \"For nearly 20 years I’ve represented Davids versus Goliaths as an attorney. Throughout that entire time period I’ve relied upon the justice system and judges sitting in court houses just like this,\" Avenatti said following the eight-minute hearing. \"I will spend the time in connection with this case and the one in New York relying on that same justice system. ... And I am highly confident that when the process plays out that justice will be done,\" he said. As Avenatti spoke to reporters, onlookers shouted \"creepy porn lawyer!\" and \"lock him up!\" Avenatti is free on $300,000 bond in the New York case. U.S. Magistrate Judge John Early did not modify the bond during the hearing in Santa Ana. Avenatti became a prominent critic of Trump and frequent cable TV guest while representing Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She filed a lawsuit against the president over a nondisclosure agreement that in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election kept her from discussing her claims that they had had an extramarital affair 10 years earlier. Avenatti also involved himself in the investigation of sexual abuse charges against R&B singer R. Kelly by giving the Chicago state’s attorney’s office what he said was a tape of the performer having sex with an underage girl. LUXURY SHOPPING Federal charging documents in Santa Ana accuse Avenatti of using a client's $1.6 million legal settlement for his own purposes, including paying $216,000 to Neiman Marcus, $68,500 at a luxury watch store, almost half a million dollars to pay a home mortgage, and thousands of dollars for a Porsche. The client is identified in court papers by the initials \"G.B.\" The charges also accuse Avenatti of fraudulently obtaining $4 million in bank loans from a Mississippi bank. In New York, prosecutors said Avenatti and an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator told attorneys for Nike that they represented a former college basketball coach with information about the company's involvement in a scheme to bribe high school basketball players. The pair threatened to go public with that information unless Nike hired Avenatti to conduct an internal investigation for $15 million to $25 million, and pay an additional $1.5 million to the client, according to prosecutors.

Two other Democratic contenders, Andrew Yang and Julian Castro, also told the conference organized by prominent civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton that they would sign a bill in Congress to create a commission to study reparations. The three Democrats, the first of a dozen 2020 presidential candidates who will speak to the conference over the next three days, also backed criminal justice reforms including the legalization of marijuana and clearing the records of non-violent drug offenders. Other Democratic contenders have embraced a bill sponsored by U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee to create a reparations commission, although O'Rourke had not taken a stance until Sharpton asked him about it. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, pledged his support with a reference to the civil rights advances of recent decades. \"Until all Americans understand that civil rights are not just those victories but the injustices that have been visited and continue to be visited on people, we will never get the change we need to live up to the promise of this country,\" he said. Reparations has become a prominent issue in the Democratic race for the nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, and Sharpton praised Castro for helping to bring it to the forefront. \"Our country will never truly heal until we address the original sin of slavery,\" Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and U.S. housing secretary, told the conference. The historically diverse 2020 Democratic field, including black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates as well as a record six women, is tackling an array of issues of interest in the African-American community following the first decline in their turnout in 20 years in 2016. That was a key contributor to Democrat Hillary Clinton's stunning loss to Trump. After a question from Sharpton, O'Rourke said police violence was the byproduct of a \"larger system - not just of criminal justice in this country. But a system that has successfully suppressed some Americans based on their race for as long as we have been a country.\" The conference in New York is giving activists from around the country a chance to judge the candidates in person. The sessions will continue on Thursday and Friday. Sharpton said not everyone would agree with the candidates on everything, but support for voting rights, healthcare access and criminal justice reform were \"not negotiable for us in the civil rights movement.\" Democrats are grappling with ways to address Trump's sometimes polarizing racial comments and what polls have found are rising racial tensions since Trump became president. The candidate who can win African-American support stands to reap significant rewards, as black voters play a big role in Democratic primaries. In South Carolina, which holds an early primary in February 2020, more than 60 percent of the Democratic primary voters were black in 2016.

Sanders said he would consider proposals that created term limits for Supreme Court justices or would rotate judges between the highest court and the lower-level appeals courts. Trump has also ruled out expanding the number of judges ahead of the election. Trump appointed conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the court since taking office in 2017, cementing its 5-4 conservative majority. Supreme Court justices are appointed for lifetime terms, and both his appointees potentially could serve for decades.

Long-shot liberal candidate Pete Buttigieg has mentioned a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices coupled with other reforms that would ensure partisan parity.

McConnell's action, with little precedent in U.S. history, enabled Trump to nominate Gorsuch in 2017, with the Republican-led Senate voting to confirm him.

Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, led the push to subpoena Carl Kline, who was White House personnel security chief for the first two years of Trump's presidency and now works for the Department of Defense. The committee voted to approve the subpoena for Kline, with 22 Democrats voting in favor and 15 Republicans against. In a letter sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Monday, Cummings said Kline had not responded to the committee's requests that he testify voluntarily. Cummings said the White House and Kline's lawyer on Monday responded he would voluntarily testify but would not answer questions about specific security clearance cases or violations. Cummings said on Tuesday these conditions were unacceptable. Tricia Newbold, a career security official at the White House for 18 years, has said the Trump administration overruled security experts to give questionable security clearances to more than two dozen people, who congressional sources said included Republican President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. In a letter to the White House on Monday, Cummings said Newbold detailed the cases of three anonymous \"senior White House officials\" whose clearances career officials recommended should be denied, though the White House went ahead and granted clearances to two of the three unnamed individuals.

Pierre Moscovici, the EU's economic affairs and tax commissioner, told a news conference on Wednesday that all the remaining 27 EU members agreed that customs controls would have to be put in place for incoming goods as soon as Britain left. \"The cliff-edge scenario, which is again not the one we foresee or wish, would create major disruptions,\" he said. \"We should expect that there would be queues at the tunnel exit and at the ports.\" Moscovici said more than 11,000 goods vehicles per day took ferries between Dover and Calais or used the Channel Tunnel, although he acknowledged that not all would be checked. He said EU companies trading with the UK had to be ready for additional costs and bureaucracy as customs checks increased, while travellers would also be subject to more checks. Individual travellers arriving in the EU from Britain would be limited to no more than 430 euros' ($480) worth of goods, and would not be able to bring in British animal products such as cheese or sausages. Producers would still be able to export them if Britain, as expected, passed laws to comply with EU sanitary rules. However, goods would be subject to import duties; in the case of cars, this would be 10 percent. IRELAND On the most sensitive issue, that of the Irish border, Moscovici avoided giving a clear answer. Since Britain has said it wants to leave the EU's customs union as it leaves the EU, the bloc says controls on animals and goods will need to take place on the land border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. But both London and the EU want to avoid deploying border infrastructure, fearing it could become the target of violence and undermine peace in the province, which saw three decades of sectarian violence at the end of the last century. Moscovici said both the EU and Britain would need to make checks to protect their markets: \"We are working closely and intensively with Ireland to organise these checks in the least disruptive way possible, and as much as possible away from the border.\" He added that the EU could give Ireland more money and other assistance to meet the challenge. He said the EU expected Britain to live up to its obligations of guaranteeing an open Irish border under the Good Friday Agreement peace deal. EU sources told Reuters in February that Dublin would soon have to come up with a plan to ensure the integrity of the EU's single market or face the prospect of checks on its own goods coming into the rest of the bloc - something Ireland has said it will not countenance.

Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators. They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October. The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial. \"The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,\" Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus. \"Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,\" said Trudeau, 47, who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re-election battle this autumn. Wilson-Raybould, who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau's announcement, was demoted in January and resigned the next month. Philpott quit shortly afterward, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter. \"If people can't express trust in the party and the prime minister, then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas. It's as simple as that,\" Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters. The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau, who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view. But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity. Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives. Trudeau, who came to power promising \"sunny ways\" and a greater role for women in politics, admitted it \"has been a difficult few weeks.\" The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, the head of the federal bureaucracy. Wilson-Raybould said on Twitter: \"I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.\" Last Friday, to back her case, she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick, who did not know she was recording him. Trudeau said that was \"unconscionable.\" Philpott said on Facebook that she \"did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister ... it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences.\" Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power.

Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr plans to make public a redacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's nearly 400-page investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 election by mid-April, \"if not sooner,\" he said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday. \"Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,\" Barr wrote in the letter to the top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate and House Judiciary committees. He said he was willing to appear before both committees to testify about Mueller's report on May 1 and May 2. On March 22, Mueller completed his 22-month probe and Barr on Sunday sent a four-page letter to Congress that outlined the main findings. Barr told lawmakers that the investigation did not establish that members of the election campaign of President Donald Trump conspired with Russia. Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida on Friday Trump said he had \"great confidence\" in Barr. Asked whether he agreed with Barr's decision to release the Mueller report to the public, Trump said, \"If that's what he'd like to do I have nothing to hide. This was a hoax. This was a witch hunt.\" Leading congressional Democrats are pressing for a quick release of the entire Mueller report. \"We need to see the Mueller report ASAP, with only those redactions that are absolutely necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods. Congress and the American people need the full story about what happened in 2016,\" said Senator Mark Warner, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. A Mueller spokesman would not comment on the letter to Congress that Barr issued on Friday. Mueller left unresolved the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the investigation. Barr said that based on the evidence presented, he concluded it was not sufficient to charge the president with obstruction. Barr said his letter on Sunday \"was not, and did not purport to be an exhaustive recounting\" of Mueller's investigation and said he believed the public should be allowed to read the report and judge for themselves. Lawmakers have since been clamoring for more details. In a statement on Friday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the April 2 deadline he imposed on Barr's Justice Department \"still stands\" and he urged the release of a \"full and complete\" report without redactions. The top Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, said on Twitter that Barr was \"following his word\" by pledging to release the report and chided Nadler for setting an arbitrary deadline. Barr said in his letter on Friday that certain information must be redacted before the report is released, including secret grand jury information, intelligence sources and methods and information that by law cannot be public or might infringe on privacy. Nadler rejected that notion, saying Barr must \"work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee.\" The federal rules of criminal procedure make it a crime for government officials to publicly divulge sensitive grand jury materials such as transcripts, unless a federal judge signs off first. Barr said on Friday that although Trump also has the right to assert executive privilege on some materials in the report to keep them from being made public, Trump has said publicly he intends to defer to Barr. Because of that, Barr added, there were no plans for the Justice Department to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review. During his investigation, Mueller brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former Trump aides.

Hussle, 33, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was shot multiple times on Sunday afternoon outside his store, Marathon Clothing, in south Los Angeles. Two other people were wounded in the shooting, police said. On Tuesday, a tipster called to report seeing the man police had named as a suspect, Eric Holder, in the suburban community of Bellflower, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies went to the site and arrested Holder, 29, and then handed him to police to be booked for murder, the statement said. Formal charges were pending and Holder was being held without bail. Hussle's debut studio album, \"Victory Lap,\" was nominated for Best Rap Album at this year's Grammy Awards. His death rattled the entertainment and hip-hop world, with celebrities posting memories of him on social media. Hussle made several mixtapes, which are generally created outside the record label system, before recording his debut album with Atlantic Records and collaborating with singer and rapper CeeLo Green and Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar. The day he died, Hussle wrote on his Twitter page, \"Having strong enemies is a blessing.\" Police officials have not described the dispute they said led to the shooting. Holder is suspected of walking up to Hussle and two other men and shooting them. Holder, a Los Angeles resident, ran down an alley and fled in a Chevy Cruze driven by a woman, the police statement said. Authorities had no information to indicate Hussle's death was related to gang activity. The area where Hussle was killed has seen an increase in shootings in recent weeks, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a news conference. Hussle had planned to meet with Steve Soboroff, president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, to prevent gang violence in his neighborhood, Soboroff said. On Monday, a crowd gathered for a vigil outside Hussle's clothing store. A disturbance set off a stampede and at least two people were critically injured, officials and media reports said.

Trump gave Kim both Korean and English-language versions of the U.S. position at Hanoi's Metropole hotel on Feb. 28, according to a source familiar with the discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity. It was the first time that Trump himself had explicitly defined what he meant by denuclearization directly to Kim, the source said. A lunch between the two leaders was canceled the same day. While neither side has presented a complete account of why the summit collapsed, the document may help explain it. The document's existence was first mentioned by White House national security adviser John Bolton in television interviews he gave after the two-day summit. Bolton did not disclose in those interviews the pivotal U.S. expectation contained in the document that North Korea should transfer its nuclear weapons and fissile material to the United States. The document appeared to represent Bolton's long-held and hardline \"Libya model\" of denuclearization that North Korea has rejected repeatedly. It probably would have been seen by Kim as insulting and provocative, analysts said. Trump had previously distanced himself in public comments from Bolton's approach and said a \"Libya model\" would be employed only if a deal could not be reached. The idea of North Korea handing over its weapons was first proposed by Bolton in 2004. He revived the proposal last year when Trump named him as national security adviser. The document was meant to provide the North Koreans with a clear and concise definition of what the United States meant by \"final, fully verifiable, denuclearization,\" the source familiar with discussions said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State Department declined to comment on what would be a classified document. After the summit, a North Korean official accused Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of \"gangster-like\" demands, saying Pyongyang was considering suspending talks with the United States and may rethink its self-imposed ban on missile and nuclear tests. The English version of the document, seen by Reuters, called for \"fully dismantling North Korea's nuclear infrastructure, chemical and biological warfare program and related dual-use capabilities; and ballistic missiles, launchers, and associated facilities.\" Aside from the call for the transfer of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and bomb fuel, the document had four other key points. It called on North Korea to provide a comprehensive declaration of its nuclear program and full access to U.S. and international inspectors; to halt all related activities and construction of any new facilities; to eliminate all nuclear infrastructure; and to transition all nuclear program scientists and technicians to commercial activities. The summit in Vietnam's capital was cut short after Trump and Kim failed to reach a deal on the extent of economic sanctions relief for North Korea in exchange for its steps to give up its nuclear program. The first summit between Trump and Kim, which took place in Singapore in June 2018, was almost called off after the North Koreans rejected Bolton's repeated demands for it to follow a denuclearization model under which components of Libya's nuclear program were shipped to the United States in 2004. Seven years after a denuclearization agreement was reached between the United States and Libya's leader, Muammar Gaddafi, the United States took part in a NATO-led military operation against his government and he was overthrown by rebels and killed. 'MISERABLE FATE' Last year, North Korea officials called Bolton's plan \"absurd\" and noted the \"miserable fate\" that befell Gaddafi. After North Korea threatened to cancel the Singapore summit, Trump said in May 2018 he was not pursuing a \"Libya model\" and that he was looking for an agreement that would protect Kim. \"He would be there, he would be running his country, his country would be very rich,\" Trump said at the time. \"The Libya model was a much different model. We decimated that country,\" Trump added. The Hanoi document was presented in what U.S. officials have said was an attempt by Trump to secure a \"big deal\" under which all sanctions would be lifted if North Korea gave up all of its weapons. U.S.-North Korean engagement has appeared to be in limbo since the Hanoi meeting. Pompeo said on March 4 he was hopeful he could send a team to North Korea \"in the next couple of weeks,\" but there has been no sign of that. Jenny Town, a North Korea expert at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said the content of the U.S. document was not surprising. \"This is what Bolton wanted from the beginning and it clearly wasn't going to work,\" Town said. \"If the U.S. was really serious about negotiations they would have learned already that this wasn't an approach they could take.\" Town added, \"It's already been rejected more than once, and to keep bringing it up ... would be rather insulting. It's a non-starter and reflects absolutely no learning curve in the process.\" North Korea has repeatedly rejected unilateral disarmament and argues that its weapons program is needed for defense, a belief reinforced by the fate Gaddafi and others. In an interview with ABC's \"This Week\" program after the Hanoi summit, Bolton said the North Koreans had committed to denuclearization in a variety of forms several times \"that they have happily violated.\" \"We define denuclearization as meaning the elimination of their nuclear weapons program, their uranium enrichment capability, their plutonium reprocessing capability,\" Bolton said. Asked who authored the document, Bolton said it had been \"written at staff level and cleared around as usual.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On the day that their talks in Hanoi collapsed last month, U.S. President Donald Trump handed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a piece of paper that included a blunt call for the transfer of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States, according to the document seen by Reuters.</p> <p>Trump gave Kim both Korean and English-language versions of the U.S. position at Hanoi's Metropole hotel on Feb. 28, according to a source familiar with the discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity.

India has tightened security in the Himalayan region since a suicide bombing on the highway killed 40 paramilitary police in February in an attack claimed by a militant group based in neighboring Pakistan. The incident nearly pitched the nuclear-armed rivals into a fourth war, and prompted India to launch a massive crackdown on militants and separatists in Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan. Politicians, rights activists and school operators in the region labeled Wednesday's move \"collective punishment\" for Kashmiris because a militant from the area carried out the attack. \"We can't run schools under these circumstances,\" said G.N.

Shaleen Kabra, an official of the state's home department, said the curbs aim to protect lives during the movement of troops around India's staggered general election that starts on April 11, with votes to be counted on May 23. \"The local administration and police will regulate civilian emergencies on the highway during these days,\" he told Reuters.

Musk's fight with the SEC, to play out in a Manhattan federal court hearing, has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the electric car maker's expansion. Tesla, which built its reputation on luxury cars, has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it is counting on to reach the mass market, recently offering a version starting at $35,000. The SEC on Feb. 25 accused Musk of violating his Oct. 2018 settlement by posting material information about Tesla on Twitter six days earlier, without first seeking approval from company lawyers. Musk has countered that the information was not material, and did not need to be vetted. The battle concerns a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: “Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\" meaning 500,000 vehicles. Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000. The SEC said the earlier tweet contrasted with Tesla's Jan. 30 forecast that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles this year. Musk's lawyers countered that the earlier tweet merely restated a forecast he had given on Jan. 30, when he said Model 3 production could total 350,000 to 500,000 vehicles. They have also said the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about his Palo Alto, California-based company. It is rare for the SEC to seek a contempt finding, though some legal experts said the regulator has a strong case over Musk's earlier tweet. \"It seems pretty clear that this particular tweet was not run through the scrubbing system that Tesla was supposed to have in place,\" said Stephen Diamond, who teaches securities law at Santa Clara University School of Law. MUSK SAYS SEC 'BROKEN' A contempt finding by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan could subject Musk to new sanctions such as a higher fine or removal from Tesla's board or as chief executive, legal experts said. James Cox, a Duke University law professor, said Nathan was unlikely to impose a severe penalty such as giving up control over Tesla. \"We have to understand that Tesla is at a very important point in its history, and I don't think any judge would want to be viewed in hindsight as the cause of the demise of Tesla,\" he said. \"She could give him a good tongue-lashing, and tell him this is it, and next time she's not going to be so nice,\" Cox added. The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit that accused Musk of violating securities laws by tweeting last Aug. 7 that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. That tweet sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent. Musk's privatization plan was at best in an early stage, however, and financing was not in place. In settling, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman, and the company said it would adopt procedures to oversee all of Musk's communications, regardless of format, and pre-approve written communications that could be material to the company. Tesla and Musk also agreed to each pay $20 million civil fines. The legal battle, which began in September, has not stopped Musk from being an outspoken critic of the SEC. He has since labeled the SEC the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission,\" recalling his attacks against hedge funds and other investors who sell Tesla stock short, hoping it will fall. In a December interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Musk said he did not have respect for the SEC. He also said his tweets had not been reviewed in advance since the settlement. And in the early morning of Feb. 26, after the SEC filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: “Something is broken with SEC oversight.”","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel</p> <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk will argue on Thursday that he did not violate a fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be held in contempt, the latest twist in a high-profile battle between the billionaire and the government.</p> <p>Musk's fight with the SEC, to play out in a Manhattan federal court hearing, has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the electric car maker's expansion. </p> <p>Tesla, which built its reputation on luxury cars, has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it is counting on to reach the mass market, recently offering a version starting at $35,000.</p> <p>The SEC on Feb. 25 accused Musk of violating his Oct. 2018 settlement by posting material information about Tesla on Twitter six days earlier, without first seeking approval from company lawyers.</p> <p>Musk has countered that the information was not material, and did not need to be vetted.</p> <p>The battle concerns a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: “Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\" meaning 500,000 vehicles.</p> <p>Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000. </p> <p>The SEC said the earlier tweet contrasted with Tesla's Jan. 30 forecast that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles this year.</p> <p>Musk's lawyers countered that the earlier tweet merely restated a forecast he had given on Jan. 30, when he said Model 3 production could total 350,000 to 500,000 vehicles.</p> <p>They have also said the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about his Palo Alto, California-based company.</p> <p>It is rare for the SEC to seek a contempt finding, though some legal experts said the regulator has a strong case over Musk's earlier tweet.</p> <p>\"It seems pretty clear that this particular tweet was not run through the scrubbing system that Tesla was supposed to have in place,\" said Stephen Diamond, who teaches securities law at Santa Clara University School of Law.</p> <p></p> <p>MUSK SAYS SEC 'BROKEN'</p> <p>A contempt finding by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan could subject Musk to new sanctions such as a higher fine or removal from Tesla's board or as chief executive, legal experts said.</p> <p>James Cox, a Duke University law professor, said Nathan was unlikely to impose a severe penalty such as giving up control over Tesla.</p> <p>\"We have to understand that Tesla is at a very important point in its history, and I don't think any judge would want to be viewed in hindsight as the cause of the demise of Tesla,\" he said.</p> <p>\"She could give him a good tongue-lashing, and tell him this is it, and next time she's not going to be so nice,\" Cox added.</p> <p>The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit that accused Musk of violating securities laws by tweeting last Aug. 7 that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private at $420 per share.</p> <p>That tweet sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent.

The comment on Twitter came ahead of an expected Supreme Court ruling by the end of June on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add the citizenship question violated federal law. \"Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question,\" Trump tweeted. \"Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!\" Trump's critics have accused the White House of encouraging an undercount by dissuading Hispanics and other immigrants from participating in the census, disproportionately affecting Democratic-leaning states and municipalities. Many states, cities and civil rights groups have gone to court over the citizenship question, which is among a series of White House policies signaling tighter control over immigration. These include Trump's declaration in February of a national emergency to obtain funds for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and his threat to close the border as soon as this week, disrupting legal crossings as well as trade. The U.S. Constitution requires a census counting the number of residents every 10 years. Results are used to draw political boundaries, allocate seats in Congress and at the state and local level, and distribute roughly $800 billion of federal funds. \"The census is the administration's new front on its war on immigration and, sadly, the president's tweet today bears out that concern,\" said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director on the House census oversight committee who now advises groups seeking an accurate 2020 count. 'VERITABLE SMORGASBORD' When Ross announced the addition of a citizenship question in March 2018, he said it was in response to a Department of Justice request for data to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects eligible voters from discrimination. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections. Non-citizens comprise about 7 percent of the 328.7 million people living in the United States. Census questionnaires have not included a citizenship question since 1950. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Jan. 15 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan that Ross broke a \"veritable smorgasbord\" of federal rules by adding the question, a decision he called \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Furman also said the Voting Rights Act was as a \"pretextual\" rationale for adding the question, a decision that Ross had \"already made for other reasons.\" The judge said the change would cause many states to lose federal funding, while Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would lose congressional seats. Furman, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, stopped short of a finding that Ross intended to discriminate against immigrants. Oral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for April 23. Steven Dillingham, who became director of the U.S. Census Bureau in January, declined to discuss Trump's tweet but said the bureau was focused on obtaining a full, complete count. He spoke to reporters at a press briefing on Monday, one year before National Census Day marking the 2020 count. 'LONG PEDIGREE' Furman's decision came in a lawsuit brought by 18 U.S. states, 15 cities and a variety of civil rights groups. In urging the Supreme Court to overturn Furman's ruling, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the Justice Department, said Ross had discretion to add the citizenship question, and that there was a \"long pedigree\" in the census for asking about citizenship or country of birth. He also said other democracies including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom ask about citizenship on their censuses. Another federal judge, Richard Seeborg in San Francisco, on March 6 also declared the citizenship question illegal. Following that ruling, the Supreme Court said it will also decide whether Ross' actions violated the Constitution's Enumeration Clause, which sets out terms for counting people. Adding the citizenship question could lead to an undercount of 4.2 million Hispanics alone, the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy estimated last month.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Susan Heavey and Jonathan Stempel</p> <p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday injected himself into one of the most consequential cases of the current Supreme Court term, saying the nation's 2020 census would be \"meaningless\" without adding a citizenship question to the questionnaire.</p> <p>The comment on Twitter came ahead of an expected Supreme Court ruling by the end of June on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add the citizenship question violated federal law.</p> <p>\"Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question,\" Trump tweeted. \"Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!\"</p> <p>Trump's critics have accused the White House of encouraging an undercount by dissuading Hispanics and other immigrants from participating in the census, disproportionately affecting Democratic-leaning states and municipalities.</p> <p>Many states, cities and civil rights groups have gone to court over the citizenship question, which is among a series of White House policies signaling tighter control over immigration.</p> <p>These include Trump's declaration in February of a national emergency to obtain funds for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and his threat to close the border as soon as this week, disrupting legal crossings as well as trade.</p> <p>The U.S. Constitution requires a census counting the number of residents every 10 years.</p> <p>Results are used to draw political boundaries, allocate seats in Congress and at the state and local level, and distribute roughly $800 billion of federal funds.</p> <p>\"The census is the administration's new front on its war on immigration and, sadly, the president's tweet today bears out that concern,\" said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director on the House census oversight committee who now advises groups seeking an accurate 2020 count.</p> <p></p> <p>'VERITABLE SMORGASBORD'</p> <p>When Ross announced the addition of a citizenship question in March 2018, he said it was in response to a Department of Justice request for data to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects eligible voters from discrimination.</p> <p>Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections.

Hundreds took to the streets of the capital after the announcement of the 82-year-old's departure, capping protests which called for the removal of an elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary people and presiding over an economy riven by cronyism. Earlier in the day, army chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah demanded the veteran ruler, who has been long in poor health, be declared immediately unfit for office. State TV later showed a frail-looking Bouteflika, dressed in a traditional winter robe, handing his resignation letter to the head of a constitutional council. Also present was Abdelkader Bensalah, chairman of the upper house of parliament, who will run the country for 90 days until elections are held. \"I have taken this step because I am keen to put an end to the current bickering,\" Bouteflika said in a letter released on state media, using his main means of communication since suffering a stroke in 2013 and largely disappearing from public view. Western powers, some of which had demanded a peaceful solution, will be relieved that Bouteflika has quit, valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer, which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner to fight militants. Analysts say it was unclear whether the demonstrations will end, however. They were started initially to protest Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth mandate but then widened to include calls from some youth and lawyers for wider reforms. As Bouteflika's grip on power started to loosen over recent days, some protesters began shifting their focus to rejecting a caretaker government appointed on Sunday. The lineup included respected technocrats but was headed by Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, who the opposition said was too close to the ruling elite dominated by business tycoons and veteran fighters of the 1954-62 independence war with France. \"What is important to us is that we do not accept the (caretaker) government,\" Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and protest leader, told Reuters before Bouteflika quit. \"Peaceful protests will continue.\" Hundreds of students marched early on Tuesday through the capital Algiers, calling for a new system in a country where more than one in four Algerians under the age of 30 - some 70 percent of the population - are unemployed. Bouteflika's supporters had sought to stop the dissent by evoking the 1990s when some 200,000 were killed in civil war with Islamists, warning even of a scenario like Syria, embroiled in an eight-year-long conflict. But only around one person was confirmed to have died during the protests, a man believed to be around 60 years old who suffered a heart attack, with most rallies peaceful and protesters cleaning up the streets before going home. In Egypt, more than 800 people were killed in the 2011 uprising that brought down Hosni Mubarak. CHANGES Algeria has transformed during the protests, with people losing fear of criticizing the government and state media first ignoring and then, after a mutiny of reporters, covering the dissent. Supporters in the ruling FLN party and business people gradually abandoned Bouteflika. The military at first stayed in the barracks but step by step increased pressure, first only indirectly in an army magazine editorial saying the military shared the same vision as the people. Then chief of staff Salah proposed last week to invoke a constitutional clause to remove Bouteflika on health grounds. In another sign the end was approaching, several oligarchs close to his camp had been banned from traveling abroad in the past few days. Tuesday started like any other weekday since the protests began, with some students protesting and others going to work after joining a mass rally on Friday, Algeria's weekend. With many at home or in restaurants at dinner time, TV stations flashed a blitz of comments from Salah that Bouteflika's removal should happen immediately. \"There is no more room to waste time ... We decided clearly ... to stand with the people so all their demands get fulfilled,\" Salah said after a meeting with senior officers, state news agency APS said. A veteran of Algeria's war for independence and the only leader many Algerians have known, Bouteflika was first elected president in 1999 and established himself by ending the civil war. He had only on Monday said he would quit before the end of his term on April 28 without giving a date. He had also vowed to undertake unspecified measures for the sake of stability, making many wonder what would happen next. An hour later, he announced he was standing down in a statement posted by APS on Twitter. Hundreds took to the streets in the city center, where the Feb. 22 mass protests first broke out, waving Algerian flags. \"The army and the people are one\" and \"Game over\", banners read.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed</p> <p>ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday, succumbing to six weeks of largely peaceful mass protests driven by youth and pressure from the powerful army against his 20-year rule.</p> <p>Hundreds took to the streets of the capital after the announcement of the 82-year-old's departure, capping protests which called for the removal of an elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary people and presiding over an economy riven by cronyism.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, army chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah demanded the veteran ruler, who has been long in poor health, be declared immediately unfit for office.</p> <p>State TV later showed a frail-looking Bouteflika, dressed in a traditional winter robe, handing his resignation letter to the head of a constitutional council.

The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump last May withdrew the country from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, accusing it of supporting terrorism and conflicts in Syria and Yemen. While the United States has set a goal of completely halting Iran's oil exports, it granted temporary import waivers to China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea to ensure low oil prices and no disruption to the global oil market. The Trump administration is currently in consultations with the importers ahead of a May 2 deadline when the waivers expire. \"In November, we granted eight oil waivers to avoid a spike in the price of oil. I can confirm today three of those importers are now at zero,\" Brian Hook, the special U.S. envoy for Iran, told reporters. Hook did not identify the three. \"There are better market conditions for us to accelerate our path to zero,\" Hook said. \"We are not looking to grant any waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime.\" Hook said U.S. oil sanctions against Iran had removed about 1.5 million barrels of Iranian oil exports from the market since May 2018. \"This has denied the regime access to well over $10 billion in (oil) revenue - a loss of at least $30 million a day,\" he said. Oil prices on Tuesday hit their highest level so far in 2019, with Brent crude approaching $70 a barrel on the prospect that more sanctions against Iran and Venezuelan disruptions could deepen an OPEC-led supply cut. Analysts believe the administration is likely to extend the waivers to the remaining five importers to placate top buyers China and India and to decrease the chance of higher oil prices. China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers that could cap Iran's crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said in January. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the waivers list. Hook said a decision on whether to extend the waivers would be made \"in due course.\" A total of 23 importers that once took Iranian oil had cut imports to zero, he added. \"With oil prices actually lower than they were when we announced our sanctions and global production stable, we are on the fast track to zeroing out all purchases of Iranian crude,\" Hook said. A senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday that the U.S. government was considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before.

Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted. He repeated that threat on Tuesday but said he had not made a decision yet: \"We're going to see what happens over the next few days.\" Closing the border could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade. Auto companies have been warning the White House privately that it would lead to the idling of U.S. plants within days because they rely on prompt deliveries of components made in Mexico. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobbying group, has been in contact with the White House to discuss the \"very negative economic consequences that would occur across the country,\" said Neil Bradley, the group's top lobbyist, on a call with reporters. Trump praised efforts by Mexico to hinder illegal immigration from Central America at its own southern border. On Monday, the Mexican government said it would help regulate the flow of migrants. “I really wanted to close it,” Trump said on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for congressional Republicans. The Mexican government has not published apprehension statistics, but a senior White House official said it had provided daily updates to the Trump administration, including specific apprehension numbers. \"They say they're going to stop them. Let's see. They have the power to stop them, they have the laws to stop them,\" Trump said earlier on Tuesday. PUSH BACK Trump has made fighting illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America a key part of his agenda, but shutting down one of the world's most used borders might be a step too far, even for many of his fellow Republicans. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Democrats in warning Trump against such a move. \"Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing,\" McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. A group representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in a statement that \"any action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U.S. economy, and in particular, the auto industry.\" Dozens of U.S. vehicle, engine, transmission and other auto parts plants could close because of a lack of components in the days after a border shutdown. It would also prevent thousands of vehicles built in Mexico from landing in U.S. dealer showrooms. Automakers exported nearly 2.6 million Mexican-made vehicles to the United States in 2018, accounting for 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the country. Some, like the Chevrolet Blazer SUV, are only made in Mexico. Retailers are also raising alarm bells, according to officials with two groups that represent hundreds of U.S. retail firms. \"It will be unprecedented self-inflicted pain,\" said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. \"We are still nervous about this and we have been talking to some of our companies about maybe ramping up direct pressure on the White House by getting CEOs to call.\" SLOWER BORDER Senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday a recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants - mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents - had already led to a slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry. \"Wait times in Brownsville (Texas) were around 180 minutes, which were two times the peaks of last year,\" said a senior DHS official on a call with reporters. \"We ended the day yesterday at Otay Mesa (California) with a backup of 150 trucks that hadn't been processed,\" the official said. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday that backups were delaying commercial traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border at several crossings. He said the government had not drastically changed its migration strategy following the shutdown threats. DHS officials said border facilities had been overwhelmed by families seeking asylum, fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Manuel Padilla, a 30-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol, would now serve as the agency's coordinator on the border response. U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimated that some 100,000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in March, the highest level in a decade. \"The system is on fire,\" a DHS official said. Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention, many of the families are released to await U.S. immigration court hearings, a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs. To try to address the problem, the Trump administration in January started sending some migrants to wait out their U.S. court dates in Mexican border cities. On Monday, DHS said it would dramatically ramp up that program, despite court challenges. The biggest priority for Nielsen is to seek action from Congress to change the immigration laws, said a DHS official. She sent a letter to Congress last week repeating many of the Trump administration's demands, including a request to quickly deport Central American minors that cross the border alone. Under current law, minors who are not from the contiguous countries of Canada and Mexico are placed in the care of sponsors in the United States, which Nielsen called a \"dangerous 'pull' factor\" for migrants. Migrant advocates and some Democrats in Congress oppose the proposed legislative changes, saying they would send vulnerable children back to dangerous situations in their home countries. Trump said he had spoken with \"a few\" Democrats on Tuesday about the administration's proposals and added: \"They're changing their minds.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U.S. southern border to fight illegal immigration, as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains.</p> <p>Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted.

The crash killed all 157 people on board and led to a global grounding of 737 MAX jets and scrutiny of the certification process for the Boeing plane. Boeing had issued guidelines to pilots on how to disable an automated anti-stall system after a deadly crash in Indonesia in October, that were followed by an emergency airworthiness directive by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Journal report, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, said the pilots had initially shut off the MCAS anti-stall system that was pushing the airplane's nose down shortly after it took off from Addis Ababa. The pilots then cranked a manual wheel in an attempt to stabilize the plane, the report said, but they eventually decided to restore power to the usual electric trim on their control yokes, likely because the manual attempt did not achieve the desired results. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Boeing declined to comment. \"We are not commenting on an active accident investigation per international protocols,\" a Boeing spokesman said. The planemaker said on Monday a proposed software enhancement package to MCAS would be submitted in the \"coming weeks\", having previously said it would deliver the fix for U.S. approval by last week. A 737 pilot told Reuters last week it was \"not physically easy to make large trim changes to correct, say, an MCAS input\" by using the wheel. \"You - or more than likely the other pilot - have to flip out a little handle and wind, much like a boat winch,\" the pilot said. The Ethiopian Airlines pilots appeared to have restored power to the electric system to cope with a persistent steep nose-down angle, the paper said. Their actions reactivated MCAS and allowed it to continue its strong downward commands that they were unable to counteract using electric thumb switches, the paper said. The FAA directive after the Indonesian crash had instructed pilots to use cut-out switches in the center console to shut off the electric power to the system. The switches should remain off for the remainder of the flight, the FAA directive said. A preliminary report by Ethiopian investigators is due within 30 days of the March 10 disaster, according to international rules governing crash investigations. Ministry of Transport spokesman Musie Yehyies said there were no plans to publish the report on Wednesday.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jamie Freed and Jason Neely</p> <p>SINGAPORE/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX jet that crashed last month had initially followed Boeing Co's emergency procedures but later deviated from them as they tried to regain control of the plane, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. </p> <p>The crash killed all 157 people on board and led to a global grounding of 737 MAX jets and scrutiny of the certification process for the Boeing plane. </p> <p>Boeing had issued guidelines to pilots on how to disable an automated anti-stall system after a deadly crash in Indonesia in October, that were followed by an emergency airworthiness directive by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). </p> <p>The Journal report, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, said the pilots had initially shut off the MCAS anti-stall system that was pushing the airplane's nose down shortly after it took off from Addis Ababa.</p> <p>The pilots then cranked a manual wheel in an attempt to stabilize the plane, the report said, but they eventually decided to restore power to the usual electric trim on their control yokes, likely because the manual attempt did not achieve the desired results.</p> <p>Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

One of Australia's most high profile extremist groups, its members last year infiltrated the youth arm of the National Party, part of the ruling coalition government, before being exposed and ejected due to their far right views. Now, the group has come to prominence again – and to the attention of security agencies – after a gunman shot 50 people dead at two New Zealand mosques. In the hours after the shootings, the Lads Society's private Facebook page lit up as its members discussed the attack and the man arrested and charged with murder, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, according to five screenshots of the Facebook messages which were provided by a person with access to the group and reviewed by Reuters. \"He had been on the scene for a while,\" said Tom Sewell, founder of the Lads Society, according to the previously undisclosed messages on the Lads Society's Facebook page. \"He made heaps on Bitcoin and paid for his own holidays, I spoke to him back in 2017 when he was donating money to everyone,\" added Sewell. In a later public statement, Sewell said he and Lads Society leaders were interviewed about the Christchurch attacks by the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's domestic spy agency. ASIO said it does not comment on specific individuals, intelligence or operational matters but was alert to the threat from people with \"extreme right-wing ideologies\". The Australian Federal Police also declined to comment when asked about any ties Tarrant had to the Lads Society. Sewell declined to comment on Tarrant or whether he knew him, and his messages provided no further details. Tarrant, who is now in custody and has said he plans to represent himself, was not available for comment. The Lads Society's page was shut down after Facebook targeted white nationalists in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. Reuters was unable to verify the claims on the since-deleted Facebook page. However, Sewell's messages to the private group on the Lads Society Facebook page, which carried the same profile photo as a photo posted on Sewell's Instagram account, add to evidence Tarrant was engaged with Australia's far right. On the 8Chan message board minutes before the attack, Tarrant posted links to a livestream video of the attack and said: \"You are all top blokes and the best bunch of cobbers a man could ask for.\" Cobber is Australian slang for friend, and a term popular among Australian white nationalists. As Australia confronts the uncomfortable truth that Tarrant was one of its own, the country has been gripped by acrimonious debate about both its past race policies and whether recent political discourse about immigration and Islam had any role to play in his radicalization. In the space of a few minutes outside a Sydney mosque the day after the Christchurch shootings, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison encapsulated the country's contradictory identity. \"We are a tolerant, multicultural society, the most successful immigration country on the planet,\" he said, before pivoting to a darker undercurrent. \"These white supremacist, white separatist views, are not new. I mean, these sentiments have sadly existed in Australia for hundreds of years.\" OFF THE RADAR Tarrant grew up in the small Australian city of Grafton, where he worked as a gym instructor and developed a passion for gaming and computers, according to local media reports citing the gym owner and his grandmother. In a \"manifesto\" distributed online just before the attack, Tarrant said he formed his racist beliefs on the internet and downplayed his links to Australia, saying he was radicalized abroad. He acted alone, the manifesto said, although he said he had donated to far-right groups from an inheritance and a cryptocurrency windfall. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz last week confirmed his country's far-right Identitarian Movement had received 1,500 euros ($1,690) from Tarrant. Most of his past nine years was spent traveling across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Tarrant was \"on nobody's radar, anywhere,\" said Morrison, spending only 45 days in the past three years in Australia. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, citing archives of the deleted Facebook account of the United Patriots Front (UPF), another Australian far-right group, Tarrant described one of that group's leaders, Blair Cottrell, as \"Emperor\". Reuters was unable to independently verify that detail. Cottrell - a muscle-bound, blond-haired carpenter - founded the UPF alongside Sewell. Sewell later started Lads Society in 2017, with Cottrell's promotional support. Cottrell, described by sources as the movement's main figurehead in Australia, still heads UPF and appears in Lads Society photos and videos but holds no formal position in that group. Cottrell told Reuters that, as best he could tell, Tarrant had donated only once to groups he was associated with - A$50 to the UPF. \"I don't believe I influenced Tarrant much at all. Maybe three years ago, he was in support of our specific opposition to that mosque development in Bendigo.\" In 2017, Cottrell and two other UPF members were found guilty of inciting contempt of Muslims after they filmed a mock beheading outside council offices to protest a mosque development in the small Victorian city. GOING MAINSTREAM White extremists gained momentum in 2014 after an Islamist gunman took a group of hostages in a Sydney cafe, analysts and members of the movement say. The following year, thousands of people attended rallies arranged by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia, and some far-right politicians spoke at the events. Suspicions about the presence of Lads Society members in the youth wing of the National Party first emerged after officials of the rural-based party noted an influx of new members from cities. After ties to the Lads Society were revealed in local media, the National Party expelled 19 people, saying in a statement in November it \"would not rest until every last one of these extremists have been identified and removed.\" In Australia's latest census, about 90 percent nominated their ancestry as Australian or European, while 2.5 percent were recorded as Muslims. Just under a quarter of Australians have a \"negative attitude\" to Muslims, according to a 2018 report from the Scanlon Foundation, a group that tracks social cohesion. FAR-RIGHT SENATOR In the wake of the Christchurch attacks, Australia's Islamophobes flooded social media with memes and messages in support of Fraser Anning, the Australian senator who blamed the bloodshed on \"an immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand\". In an interview with Reuters, Anning said he was \"completely opposed\" to the attacks in Christchurch. However, he echoed the \"replacement theory\" embraced by Tarrant and the global white supremacist movement. Muslims, he said, \"are going to outbreed us very quickly\". Anning has picked up 28,600 Facebook followers in the past four weeks, data provided by his office shows, and now has more than 122,000 followers. Sewell and Cottrell in statements and interviews with Reuters and other media, also said they were appalled by the attacks on the mosques. \"Politically motivated violence is not in the interest of our organization or our community,\" Sewell said in his since-deleted Facebook statement on March 20. In his interview with Reuters, Sewell said further that Tarrant's violence had caused governments to become \"extremely reactionary\", passing legislation \"without thinking it through\". New Zealand moved swiftly to ban the kinds of semi-automatic weapons used in the attacks. \"We have a new level of totalitarian thought crime legislation across New Zealand and shortly here in Australia too,\" Sewell added.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Byron Kaye and Tom Allard</p> <p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - From its clubhouses in Melbourne and Sydney, the Lads Society promotes drug-free living and exercise, as well as \"white resistance\" and Islamophobia, according to online statements and interviews with two of its leaders.</p> <p>One of Australia's most high profile extremist groups, its members last year infiltrated the youth arm of the National Party, part of the ruling coalition government, before being exposed and ejected due to their far right views.</p> <p>Now, the group has come to prominence again – and to the attention of security agencies – after a gunman shot 50 people dead at two New Zealand mosques.</p> <p>In the hours after the shootings, the Lads Society's private Facebook page lit up as its members discussed the attack and the man arrested and charged with murder, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, according to five screenshots of the Facebook messages which were provided by a person with access to the group and reviewed by Reuters.</p> <p>\"He had been on the scene for a while,\" said Tom Sewell, founder of the Lads Society, according to the previously undisclosed messages on the Lads Society's Facebook page. </p> <p>\"He made heaps on Bitcoin and paid for his own holidays, I spoke to him back in 2017 when he was donating money to everyone,\" added Sewell. </p> <p>In a later public statement, Sewell said he and Lads Society leaders were interviewed about the Christchurch attacks by the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's domestic spy agency. </p> <p>ASIO said it does not comment on specific individuals, intelligence or operational matters but was alert to the threat from people with \"extreme right-wing ideologies\".

Lawmakers will also consider subpoenas for underlying evidence from Mueller's investigation and from five former aides to President Donald Trump, including White House counsel Donald McGahn and political adviser Steve Bannon. The committee said on Monday that they may have documents related to the Mueller probe. Democrats have become increasingly frustrated over U.S. Attorney General William Barr's plan to share only a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page investigative report with Congress. The committee will vote on a resolution to allow House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue subpoenas at his own discretion. The Mueller report describes his office's 22-month probe, which did not establish that members of Trump's campaign conspired with Russia but also did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, according to a four-page summary Barr released on March 24. Barr said Mueller's team had not found enough proof to warrant bringing obstruction charges against the president. Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president. But Democrats have taken issue with Barr's intervention. \"Congress, not the attorney general, has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred,\" Nadler wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed on Monday. \"It is not the attorney general's job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel's. That responsibility falls to Congress - and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee - as it has in every similar investigation in modern history.\" A week ago, Nadler and the Democratic heads of five other House committees gave Barr until Tuesday to provide the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Barr said he would issue his redacted version by mid-April or sooner. Trump on Monday took aim at Democrats in the aftermath of the Mueller probe. \"No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!\" the president said on Twitter. Republicans on the judiciary panel say Congress does not need the unredacted Mueller report to do its job and accuse Democrats of setting arbitrary deadlines as part of a partisan campaign to undermine Trump ahead of the 2020 election. \"The attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required,\" Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, said in a statement. But Democrats say Republicans helped set a precedent for Congress to obtain underlying investigative material during their investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The committee said the Justice Department gave Congress more than 880,000 pages of internal investigative records from the Clinton probe as well as classified and sensitive law enforcement information from an early Russia probe that Mueller took over. In addition to McGahn and Bannon, the committee will consider subpoenas for former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson. The five former Trump aides were among 81 individuals, agencies and other entities that received document requests on March 4 as part of the committee's obstruction and corruption investigation of Trump and his associates.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By David Morgan</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee said it will vote on Wednesday on whether to authorize subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>Lawmakers will also consider subpoenas for underlying evidence from Mueller's investigation and from five former aides to President Donald Trump, including White House counsel Donald McGahn and political adviser Steve Bannon.

And there's nothing the U.S. government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster-aid programs, U.S. Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight. The USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage, Northey said, a problem never before seen on this scale. That's in part because U.S. farmers have never stored so much of their harvests, after years of oversupplied markets, low prices and the latest blow of lost sales from the U.S. trade war with China - previously their biggest buyer of soybean exports. The USDA last year made $12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade-war losses, without needing Congressional approval. The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters, compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather, and help them remove debris left in fields after floods. But it has no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored-crop losses from the widespread flooding, triggered by the \"bomb cyclone\" that hit the region in mid-March. Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm, according to Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters. \"It's not traditionally been covered,\" he said. \"But we've not usually had as many losses.\" Indigo Ag, an agriculture technology company, identified 832 on-farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas. They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans - worth between $17.3 million to $34.6 million - that could have been damaged in the floods, the company told Reuters. Across the United States, farmers held soybean stocks of 2.716 billion bushels as of March 1, the largest on record for the time period, the USDA said on Friday. Corn stocks were the third-largest on record. Some Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage, Northey said. But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley told farmers at a meeting in Malvern, Iowa. \"If we have to pass a bill to do it, I hate to tell you how long that takes,\" said the senator from Iowa, who joined Northey on the helicopter tour. With farm incomes declining for years before the flood, many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live, pay their taxes or finance operations, including planting this spring. THROWING AWAY CROPS From the helicopter, piloted by National Guard members, officials surveyed miles of flooded fields in Iowa, littered with lawn chairs, fuel tanks, furniture, tires and other flood debris. Farmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater, which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields. Near Crescent, Iowa, farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60,000 bushels of his grain, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He tried to move the crops before the flood, but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks. \"We were just hurrying like hell,\" Rief said. \"Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage.\" The USDA does not have a program that covers flood-damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters, allowing them to move crops and limit losses, said Tom Vilsack, who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama. In this case, floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways. The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water. Near Percival, Iowa, railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken. A Deere & Co (DE.N) dealership, Wendy's restaurant, Motel 6 and gas station nearby were also underwater, along with homes, cars and farm equipment. Some farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods. The equipment was still parked there during the flyover on Friday. DISASTER RELIEF 'GAP' About 416,000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded, said Amanda De Jong, state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency. Of that, about 309,000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands, De Jong said last week. She estimated the program would need about $34 million to clean up the fields. Iowa's agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the U.S. government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged. \"This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed,\" said Naig, who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper. Time is short for a solution, said Carol Vinton, supervisor of Mills County, Iowa, one of the state's two most heavily damaged counties. Vinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators. The USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster, Northey said. \"They spent all last year raising that crop, putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed,\" he said. \"And now they're going to have to spend time just to get rid of it - just to clean the place up.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Tom Polansek</p> <p>MALVERN, Iowa (Reuters) - The Black Hawk military helicopter flew over Iowa, giving a senior U.S. agriculture official and U.S. senator an eyeful of the flood damage below, where yellow corn from ruptured metal silos spilled out into the muddy water.</p> <p>And there's nothing the U.S. government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster-aid programs, U.S. Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight.</p> <p>The USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage, Northey said, a problem never before seen on this scale.

The State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump's repeated threats to end U.S. foreign assistance programs with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Without providing evidence, Trump said on Friday the countries had \"set up\" caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States. A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries, known collectively as the Northern Triangle, has sought to enter the United States in recent days. Congressional aides and U.S. officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated, and even some of Trump's fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid, much of which aims to reduce violence, gang activity and the illicit drug trade - all factors that send migrants north. \"If we cut all this funding, and a lot of it, quite honestly, is seriously law enforcement that we're doing down there ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. The State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was \"carrying out the President's direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle\" and would engage Congress. The U.S. fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram – or dedicate to other purposes – about $450 million in fiscal-year 2018 funds. In addition, according to the aide, the department planned to review fiscal-year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated, but not spent, and redirect those to other purposes. The aide and others said, however, that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved, what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them. Asked if the department knew what programs would be cut, a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"If they do, they haven't told us yet. My sense is they are trying to figure that out.\" 'TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE' A former U.S. official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on. \"Nobody knows what this is,\" he said, adding that by midday on Monday, no instructions had been sent to U.S. aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision. The situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year's Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U.S. aid for Pakistan, sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing. Critics argued the administration's planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face. \"It's totally counterproductive,\" said Rebecca Bill Chavez, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama's administration and who is now at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. \"If the intent is to slow migration, this is going to have the opposite effect,\" she added. Speaking on ABC News' \"This Week\" program on Sunday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the \"Northern Triangle\" countries and Mexico, where the migrants typically enter the United States. \"You can make all the promises you want but when you're still sending 100,000 people across the southern border, actions speak louder than words,\" Mulvaney said. \"We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance.\" Democrats were scathing about the planned cuts. \"Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration - reduce poverty, violence, gangs, improve rule of law, and reform justice systems,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration.</p> <p>The State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump's repeated threats to end U.S. foreign assistance programs with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.</p> <p>Without providing evidence, Trump said on Friday the countries had \"set up\" caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States.

Political crises have pushed up borrowing costs in euro zone countries such as Greece and Italy in recent years. In Britain, Parliament has rejected May's divorce deal three times and failed to back an alternative, risking a chaotic no-deal Brexit as soon as April 12, although May on Tuesday announced cross-party talks to break the impasse. But interest rates on Britain's roughly 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.0 trillion) of government bonds, known as gilts, have fallen. The main reason is that gilts, representing one of the world's major government bond markets, are influenced mostly by the ebbs and flows of the global economy and financial markets. But other factors are at work too. Below is a look at some of the reasons for the strong demand for gilts in the face of Britain's political chaos. GLOBAL SLOWDOWN The central banks of the United States and the euro zone recently rowed back on their plans to remove the stimulus they have been providing since the global financial crisis, reflecting worries about a slowdown in the global economy. This has been a major factor in driving gilt yields lower and they have fallen this year in step with those of other major government bonds across the Group of Seven rich countries. For a graphic on G7 benchmark 10-year government bond yields, see - tmsnrt.rs/2CRlp8T Last week the 10-year gilt yield fell below 1 percent for the first time in 18 months, although it rebounded to 1.07 percent on Wednesday as investors judged May's latest plan as likely to cut the risk of a no-deal Brexit. STILL A SAFE HAVEN British government bonds retain high credit ratings even after losing their top-notch triple-A grades as Britain's economy and public finances struggled to recover from effects of last decade's global financial crisis. Part of gilts' appeal is Britain's track record, stretching back hundreds of years, of not defaulting on its debt, bolstered by the fact it issues its own currency. Although British government debt levels rocketed in the aftermath of the crisis, gilts are still regarded by investors as a safe place to store money when the going gets tough. \"Ultimately, there's someone always willing to buy the debt, unless you make a complete hash of it -- we're talking the Venezuela, Turkey arena,\" said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services. BIG DOMESTIC OWNERSHIP British domestic investors like pension funds and insurance firms, plus the Bank of England, account for the vast majority of gilt holdings, cutting the risk that a sell-off from foreign owners of gilts would wreak havoc in the market. Foreign owners accounted for 25 percent of British government debt securities in 2017, compared with 30 percent in Italy and 47 percent in France, according to Eurostat data. LONG IN THE TOOTH When a government bond matures, meaning the government repays bondholders what they have lent it, they have an opportunity to move their money elsewhere if they choose. The average maturity for gilts is much longer than for equivalent European government bonds, meaning investors have fewer opportunities to move out of British debt -- another factor that adds to the relative stability of gilts. The average maturity for British bonds is 14.9 years, compared with 7.5 in France, 6.9 in Italy, and 6.3 in Germany, according to European Central Bank data. BREXIT EFFECT? LOOK TO THE FTSE Gilts' current strength also probably reflects the relatively poor performance of the British stock market, which along with the pound has borne the brunt of shifts in investor appetite in response to Brexit developments. Although the FTSE 100 is up 10 percent year-to-date, it is vying with Spain's IBEX as the worst performer among the major European bourses in 2019. Some of the money that could have sent British stocks higher probably found its way into gilts. \"People say 'what about Brexit?', but investors say 'where else am I meant to invest my money'?\" Ostwald said.

Documents filed by the Secret Service on Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida say that shortly after noon on Saturday, Yujing Zhang approached a Secret Service agent screening visitors to Mar-a-Lago seeking entrance to the club. Zhang produced two Chinese passports displaying her photo and said she wanted to go to the pool. Secret Service officers could not initially find her name on an access list for the property, according to the Secret Service affidavit filed with the court. A club manager said that a man named Zhang was a club member, and even though Yujing Zhang did not give a clear answer as to whether the man was her father, the Secret Service affidavit says resort officials allowed her on the property on the assumption she was related to a member. Resort personnel became suspicious after Zhang appeared to have trouble explaining why she was visiting Mar-a-Lago, according to the affidavit. Zhang initially said she was there for an event staged by a group called the United Nations Chinese American Association. But resort staff found no such event was scheduled, according to the court filing. A receptionist then contacted Secret Service personnel who questioned Zhang and concluded she did not have \"any legitimate documentation\" authorizing her entry to Mar-a-Lago, according to the filing. After detaining her, investigators found in Zhang's possession four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive device and a thumb drive, the Secret Service court filing says. Initial examination of the thumb drive determined it contained \"malicious malware,\" the Secret Service said. \"While the Secret Service does not determine who is permitted to enter the club, our agents and officers conduct physical screenings to ensure no prohibited items are allowed onto the property,\" the Secret Service said in a statement. Responding to a question on the case, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday: \"I have no understanding of the situation you mention.\" In a court filing on Tuesday, a public defender representing Zhang said she was invoking her right to remain silent. A Justice Department spokeswoman had no comment on the arrest.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Mark Hosenball</p> <p>(Reuters) - A Chinese woman who passed security checkpoints at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida carrying a thumb drive coded with \"malicious\" software was arrested on Saturday for entering a restricted property and making false statements to officials, according to a court filing.</p> <p>Documents filed by the Secret Service on Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida say that shortly after noon on Saturday, Yujing Zhang approached a Secret Service agent screening visitors to Mar-a-Lago seeking entrance to the club. </p> <p>Zhang produced two Chinese passports displaying her photo and said she wanted to go to the pool.

President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U.S. southern border to fight illegal immigration, amid pressure from companies worried that a shutdown would inflict chaos on supply chains and the $1.7 billion daily trade. But the reshuffling of border agents, announced last week to process the record number of migrant families entering the United States from Mexico, prompted delays of up to 12 hours for trucks crossing from Mexico's Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, truckers told Reuters. \"Industry is most affected by this situation, due to the millions in fines they have to pay when deliveries arrive late to clients,\" said Manuel Sotelo, head of the truckers union in Ciudad Juarez. He said the delays could even lead to the cancellation of contracts and layoffs. Senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday the recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants - mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents - led to the slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry. \"The U.S. threat is being carried out and having an impact on factories, transportation companies and most directly on drivers,\" truck driver Jose Cota said. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement that, as of Monday, the Otay Mesa commercial facility, one of the ports of entry at the San Diego-Tijuana crossing, would operate eight out of the 10 truck lanes for the inspection and processing of imports and conveyances from Mexico. \"The indefinite reduction of processing lanes at the Otay Mesa commercial facility is due to this deployment (of agents). As such, we will be unable to extend the hours of operation impacting our ability to provide services after our regular closing times,\" it said. Mexico's customs agency said the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo crossing from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas into Texas was also affected and asked truck drivers to reschedule their deliveries considering that the port of entry would now close at 11:00 p.m. daily. Trump said on Friday he would close the border this week unless Mexico acted to curb a surge of asylum seekers from countries in Central America. He backed off that on Tuesday, saying that Mexico had made progress in detaining migrant flows. Long lines of trucks started forming at the border crossings from Friday, as the number of agents was cut, said Cota, who had been waiting since 6 a.m. to cross into El Paso. \"There is no danger ... this is just the United States government's way of pressuring and blackmailing,\" Cota said. Mexico's foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, also noted that commercial traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border had slowed at several crossings due to the transfer of U.S. border agents. \"They don't intend on shutting (the border) but they have this problem that they are reallocating personnel,\" Ebrard said. He said Mexico would be prepared for the possibility of a border shutdown if it were to happen.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jose Luis Gonzalez and Lizbeth Diaz</p> <p>CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Trucks delivering goods from Mexico to the United States are facing up to 12 hours of gridlock, drivers said, after a transfer of U.S. border agents to immigration duties slowed the flow of commercial traffic at several border crossings.</p> <p>President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U.S. southern border to fight illegal immigration, amid pressure from companies worried that a shutdown would inflict chaos on supply chains and the $1.7 billion daily trade.</p> <p>But the reshuffling of border agents, announced last week to process the record number of migrant families entering the United States from Mexico, prompted delays of up to 12 hours for trucks crossing from Mexico's Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, truckers told Reuters.</p> <p>\"Industry is most affected by this situation, due to the millions in fines they have to pay when deliveries arrive late to clients,\" said Manuel Sotelo, head of the truckers union in Ciudad Juarez.

Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a shock referendum result, it is still unclear how, when or if it will ever indeed quit the European club it first joined in 1973. In a hastily arranged statement from her Downing Street office after spending seven hours chairing cabinet meetings on how to plot a way out of the Brexit maze, May said she was seeking another short extension to Brexit beyond April 12. Her move offers the prospect of keeping the United Kingdom in a much closer economic relationship with the EU after Brexit - though it could also rip her Conservative Party apart as half her lawmakers want a decisive split from the bloc. \"I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan - that we would both stick to - to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal,\" she said. \"We will need a further extension of Article 50 (divorce notification), one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal. We need to be clear what such an extension is for - to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way.\" Corbyn said he would be \"very happy\" to meet May and that he would set no limits ahead of the talks, while reiterating that his party aimed to keep a customs union with the EU, access for Britain to its single market and protections for workers. He added that he would hold a vote of no-confidence in the government in reserve if any eventual accord still failed to achieve majority support in a deeply split British parliament. Germany and France called for more clarity from London, warning that without a clear sense of what Britain wanted it could be heading towards a disorderly Brexit within days. The EU's Donald Tusk called for patience with London. MAY'S GAMBLE INFURIATES PARTY EUROSCEPTICS Keeping Britain closely tied to the EU after Brexit is anathema to much of the Conservative Party. Many Brexit-backing Conservatives were livid at May over her overture to Corbyn. \"This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach, it is not in the interests of the country, it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn't bode well for it,\" Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent Brexiteer, told reporters following a meeting of the party's hardline eurosceptic parliamentary group. Boris Johnson, the face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, said a compromise with Labour would betray the referendum, asserting that the world's fifth biggest economy could be outside the EU but still subject to EU rules. \"Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration,\" said Johnson, who resigned as foreign minister last July. Still, May faced no immediate resignations from her senior team. Prominent Brexit supporters in May's cabinet, such as Michael Gove, defended her plan in public after a marathon meeting at which ministers haggled for hours over coffee and sandwiches. They finished with Chilean red wine. Any plan, May said, would have to include the current Withdrawal Agreement that she agreed with the EU in November and which the bloc says it will not reopen. May last week offered to quit if parliament approved her deal but lawmakers defeated it a third time on Friday, the very day Britain had been due to leave the EU. Brexiteers say her deal would trap Britain in the EU's orbit indefinitely but pro-EU opposition parties say her proposed break would isolate Britain and cause lasting economic damage. Lawmakers failed on Monday to find a majority of their own for any alternative plan ranging from a permanent customs union to a confirmatory referendum on any deal and a revocation of the divorce papers to avoid a no-deal crash-out. NEW OPTIONS FOR PARLIAMENT? May said that if she could not agree a unified approach with Corbyn, a veteran socialist who voted against joining the bloc in 1975, then the government would come up with a number of options on the future relationship with the EU. Then, she said, the government would put them before the House of Commons in a series of votes. \"Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house,\" May said. Her move could cleave apart her Conservatives, who have been grappling with an internal schism over Europe for the past three decades. Over half of her lawmakers voted last week to go for a no-deal Brexit, much to the alarm of British business. \"It seems to me that she wants to rely upon Labour votes to get this extension through,\" David Jones, a Brexit-supporting former Conservative minister, told Reuters. \"If she does that, then she is putting the future of the party in peril.\" May said she wanted the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to be passed before May 22 so that the United Kingdom did not have to take part in elections that month to the European Parliament. Her spokesman said it was possible to cancel participation in the European elections right up to the day of the vote. The impasse has already delayed Brexit for at least two weeks beyond the planned departure date of March 29 to 2200 GMT on April 12. \"This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands,\" May said. \"But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Guy Faulconbridge, Elizabeth Piper and Kate Holton</p> <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour leader, a last-ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain's departure that enraged many in her party.</p> <p>Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a shock referendum result, it is still unclear how, when or if it will ever indeed quit the European club it first joined in 1973.</p> <p>In a hastily arranged statement from her Downing Street office after spending seven hours chairing cabinet meetings on how to plot a way out of the Brexit maze, May said she was seeking another short extension to Brexit beyond April 12.</p> <p>Her move offers the prospect of keeping the United Kingdom in a much closer economic relationship with the EU after Brexit - though it could also rip her Conservative Party apart as half her lawmakers want a decisive split from the bloc.</p> <p>\"I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan - that we would both stick to - to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We will need a further extension of Article 50 (divorce notification), one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.

The unusual denunciation from two Supreme Court justices came in a concurring opinion to a ruling that unanimously affirmed the death sentence of a convicted killer. It was the court's first death penalty decision since Governor Gavin Newsom two weeks ago imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in the nation's most populous state. The concurring opinion was written by Associate Justice Goodwin Liu and joined by Associate Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, both appointees of Newsom's predecessor and fellow Democrat, Jerry Brown. Liu and Cuellar said their critique had nothing to do with \"morality or constitutionality of the death penalty,\" and expressed empathy for victims and their families. In their commentary, the justices pointed to the case at hand in the appeal of Thomas Potts, condemned in 1998 for the hatchet-stabbing murders and robbery of an elderly couple in their Hanford, California, home, where Potts worked as a part-time handyman. \"Now, 21 years later, we affirm the judgment on direct appeal, but there is more litigation to come in the form of habeas corpus petitions in state and federal courts,\" Liu and Cuellar wrote. Such a timeline is typical in capital cases, they said, adding that \"serious challenges\" in the fair, efficient administration of the death penalty \"have not been meaningfully addressed\" for decades. \"As a result, California's death penalty is an expensive and dysfunctional system that does not deliver justice or closure in a timely manner, if at all,\" the justices asserted. Voters passed a 2016 ballot measure to speed up the process, but that initiative has failed to work, largely because it lacked additional funding needed to implement necessary reforms, the justices wrote. The justices, however, vowed to continue to uphold death sentences \"when the law requires.\" Newsom had cited personal conscience as a major factor in ordering a halt to executions. The governor, who has said he has concerns that dozens of the 737 inmates on the state's death row were innocent, issued a statement on Thursday praising the concurring opinion of two justices. California, which has by far the largest number of inmates on death row, last put a person to death in 2006. Newsom signed his moratorium on executions of current death row inmates as the state moved toward resuming capital punishment after developing a new protocol for lethal injections.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Steve Gorman</p> <p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two members of California's highest court issued a scathing critique of capital punishment on Thursday, branding it an \"expensive and dysfunctional system\" that fails to deliver timely justice.</p> <p>The unusual denunciation from two Supreme Court justices came in a concurring opinion to a ruling that unanimously affirmed the death sentence of a convicted killer.

According to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, Hayes worked with business executive Greg Lindberg to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey. Causey reported the effort to law enforcement officials and cooperated in the investigation, authorities say. The two men, along with insurance executives John Gray, 68, and John Palermo, 63, were charged with bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. Hayes is also charged with lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. All four men pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for Hayes and Lindberg said their clients looked forward to clearing their names in court. Lawyers for Gray and Palermo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the indictment, the four men promised to spend millions of dollars on Causey's re-election if he would remove an insurance regulator that oversaw companies under Lindberg's control. They said they would set up independent campaign committees that would spend $1.5 million on Causey's re-election bid and funnel another $250,000 through the state Republican party. Hayes encouraged the others to transfer the money in smaller amounts to avoid detection, the indictment said. \"My concern, any large amount like that's gonna draw attention,\" he said, according to the charges. Lindberg is the founder and chairman of investment company Eli Global and the owner of Global Bankers Insurance Group, which controls several insurance companies. Neither company was charged, and Global Bankers said it was cooperating with the investigation. Lindberg is the state's biggest political donor in recent years, with total contributions of more than $5 million, mostly to Republicans, according to news site WRAL. Hayes served in the U.S. Congress from 1999 to 2009. He led the state party between 2011 and 2013, when it won a dominant majority in the state legislature, and again since 2016. He announced yesterday that he would step down from the position. Lindberg and Gray also enlisted another public official, who made several calls to Causey on their behalf after they contributed $150,000 to a political committee supporting his candidacy, according to the indictment. That official, identified by Politico as U.S. Republican Representative Mark Walker, was not charged. A spokesman for Walker said he had committed no wrongdoing and had assisted the investigation. The North Carolina Republican Party said it has been cooperating with the probe for several months. The party has suffered a series of setbacks after several years in which it controlled the state government, pushing through spending cuts, voting restrictions, and other conservative policies. An absentee ballot fraud scheme run by a party operative has forced the rerun of a 2018 U.S. congressional election, and a federal court ruled last year that state Republicans illegally drew U.S. congressional districts to benefit their party. Democrat Roy Cooper was elected as governor in 2016, breaking the Republican grip on state politics, and Democrats made significant gains in state assembly elections last year.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Andy Sullivan</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it had charged the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, Robert \"Robin\" Hayes, and a major political donor in a corruption scheme that targeted a state official.</p> <p>According to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, Hayes worked with business executive Greg Lindberg to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.

The new law passed by parliament on Thursday is in response to a lone gunman attack on two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 which killed 50 people as they attended Friday prayers. The gunman broadcasted his attack live on Facebook and it was widely shared for over an hour before being removed, a timeframe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as unacceptable. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea. New Zealand police said on Thursday that Tarrant will face a total of 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges when he appears in court on Friday. Under the new laws, it is now an offence in Australia for companies, such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet's Google, which owns YouTube, not to remove any videos or photographs that show murder, torture or rape without delay. Companies must also inform Australian police within a \"reasonable\" timeframe. \"It is important that we make a very clear statement to social media companies that we expect their behavior to change,\" Australian Minister for Communications and the Arts Mitch Fifield told reporters in Canberra. Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter described the laws as a \"world first in terms of legislating the conduct of social media and online platforms\". Juries will decide whether companies have complied with the timetable, heightening the risk of high-profile convictions. \"Whenever there are juries involved, they can get it wrong but when you add into the mix technology - which is complex - the risk is heightened,\" Jason Bosland, professor of media law, University of Melbourne told Reuters. Technology firms said they are already working on the issue. \"We have zero tolerance for terrorist content on our platforms,\" said a spokesperson for Google in an emailed statement. \"We are committed to leading the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing terrorist content.\" A spokeswoman for Facebook was not immediately available for comment. Facebook said last week it was exploring restrictions on who can access their live video-streaming service, depending on factors such as previous violations of the site's community standards. Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI) - of which Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon and Twitter are members - said the laws fail to understand the complexity of removing violent content. \"With the vast volumes of content uploaded to the internet every second, this is a highly complex problem,\" said Sunita Bose, Managing Director of DIGI. Australia's opposition Labor party backed the legislation, but said it will consult with the technology industry over possible amendments if it wins power at an election due in May.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Colin Packham</p> <p>CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will fine social media and web hosting companies up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover and imprison executives for up to three years if violent content is not removed \"expeditiously\" under a new law.</p> <p>The new law passed by parliament on Thursday is in response to a lone gunman attack on two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 which killed 50 people as they attended Friday prayers.</p> <p>The gunman broadcasted his attack live on Facebook and it was widely shared for over an hour before being removed, a timeframe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as unacceptable.</p> <p>Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea.</p> <p>New Zealand police said on Thursday that Tarrant will face a total of 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges when he appears in court on Friday.</p> <p>Under the new laws, it is now an offence in Australia for companies, such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet's Google, which owns YouTube, not to remove any videos or photographs that show murder, torture or rape without delay. </p> <p>Companies must also inform Australian police within a \"reasonable\" timeframe.</p> <p>\"It is important that we make a very clear statement to social media companies that we expect their behavior to change,\" Australian Minister for Communications and the Arts Mitch Fifield told reporters in Canberra.</p> <p>Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter described the laws as a \"world first in terms of legislating the conduct of social media and online platforms\".</p> <p>Juries will decide whether companies have complied with the timetable, heightening the risk of high-profile convictions.</p> <p>\"Whenever there are juries involved, they can get it wrong but when you add into the mix technology - which is complex - the risk is heightened,\" Jason Bosland, professor of media law, University of Melbourne told Reuters.</p> <p>Technology firms said they are already working on the issue.</p> <p>\"We have zero tolerance for terrorist content on our platforms,\" said a spokesperson for Google in an emailed statement.</p> <p>\"We are committed to leading the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing terrorist content.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Facebook was not immediately available for comment.</p> <p>Facebook said last week it was exploring restrictions on who can access their live video-streaming service, depending on factors such as previous violations of the site's community standards.</p> <p>Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI) - of which Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon and Twitter are members - said the laws fail to understand the complexity of removing violent content.</p> <p>\"With the vast volumes of content uploaded to the internet every second, this is a highly complex problem,\" said Sunita Bose, Managing Director of DIGI. </p> <p>Australia's opposition Labor party backed the legislation, but said it will consult with the technology industry over possible amendments if it wins power at an election due in May. </p> <p></p> <p></p>","videoUrls":["https://vm.reuters.tv/9f5fa/305608_LONG_NZ_ShootingAusLaws_190404(305646_R21MP41500).mp4","https://vm.reuters.tv/64cdb/baca3vyhlmb-1404k.mp4"],"url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-shooting-australia-laws/tech-firms-face-fines-jail-over-violent-content-under-new-australian-laws-idUSKCN1RG06O","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:44:40Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"World News","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/worldNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"Tea, bingo and cockles - my journey to Brexit-on-Sea","datePublished":"2019-04-04T06:30:15","datePublishedRaw":"April 4, 2019 / 6:30 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","author":"https://www.reuters.com/journalists/clodagh-kilcoyne","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190404&t=2&i=1373343810&r=LYNXNPEF330DR","description":"The thing about an old rusty tractor, said cockle-picker Tony McClure, is that even in the sea air, it will start.","articleBody":"By Clodagh Kilcoyne FLOOKBURGH SANDS, England (Reuters) - The thing about an old rusty tractor, said cockle-picker Tony McClure, is that even in the sea air, it will start. His was parked out on the tidal flats of Flookburgh sands in Morecambe Bay in northwest England, braving the salty shallows of an unusually warm February dawn. He was comparing old mechanical tractors to the more modern electronic kind, and I was well aware of what he was talking about. The tide here comes in fast: If you're not careful, it can swamp a vehicle. So you want be certain to get off that seabed. McClure 39, was one of the first people I met on a February-March assignment around England's coastline, where I was photographing and talking to people who had voted to leave the European Union. Like most of the 50 or so people I met and spoke to while traveling from Morecambe to St. Agnes in Cornwall, McClure wants Britain to get out of the EU. Most spoke as if they felt tricked by Brussels and trapped in a world that was turning against them. \"They've wound us in their little web, with their laws and suchlike as that, and they rule us,\" said John Eldin, a 77-year-old on the eastern coast. \"They block anything that we want,\" said Tony Brown, 59, having a pint in Barrow-in-Furness. \"Over the last couple of decades we have been assimilated into something we didn't agree to be part of,\" said Tom Morris, a 34-year-old drag queen in Brighton, who voted Leave. I'd embarked on the journey because, looking at the UK from Ireland, I'd noticed something about the coastal areas. The overall result of the 2016 referendum on leaving the EU was tight (51.89 percent voted Leave versus 48.11 percent Remain), but on the coast, the Leave vote had been particularly strong - Leave won a majority in more than 100 of about 120 parliamentary constituencies with a coastline. I wanted to know more about the people who delivered that result. The trip was a revelation. First, people were often surprised to be asked their views, saying they felt they weren't important enough for anyone in London to ask. People plied me with tea, biscuits and sandwiches, took me on tractor rides and to the bingo and made a few jokey marriage proposals. Most said they still wanted to get out of Europe. Their reasons were more individual and varied than I expected. Some wanted to revive a nostalgic rosy past or keep immigrants out. Some thought they were taking back control, some wanted an end to the EU bureaucracy that they saw hurting their livelihoods and some - like a cockle-picker in Flookburgh - thought it was time London paid attention to smaller voices. But others had more concrete goals: A grandmother in Skegness hoped that the decline of her town - designated the \"most deprived seaside area in Britain\" in a study by the Office for National Statistics in 2013 - might be slowed down if taxpayers' funds stopped heading to Europe. And people like fisherwoman Margaret Owen wanted better leaders. \"We need to stand on our own two feet, we're a capable country,\" she said. \"The people that we trusted in and that we voted for, and that we thought could carry our hopes and dreams through, have let the whole country down.\" Among the few Brexit dissenters I met was Chris Baker, a 51-year-old web designer and massage therapist. Like most people in Brighton, he voted Remain. Europe has been \"the greatest peacekeeping arrangement that we've had for a very long time,\" he said. PENNY ARCADES It was the off-season and as I arrived on the east coast, a storm was on the way. Seaside towns are notoriously seasonal but people living in towns on England's coast are more likely than average to suffer from deprivation, a government study from 2015 found. From the rusting remains of Redcar's steelworks to the windswept skeleton of a fairground shut for the winter in Skegness, people I met said that all they wanted was to find a way to make a living. In Whitby, a picturesque town whose fishing industry has largely given way to tourism, kipper smoker Derek Brown held up some herring and pointed out that none of the fish he used were locally caught. For the past 30 years or so they have all been imported from Norway and Iceland. The smokers \"defrost them overnight\" he muttered, as if passing on a secret recipe. In Redcar, oil tankers passed along the coast. A handful of golfers were out on the links, but in town, places were closed down, door after door. Those shops that weren't closed were bargain pound shops, charity shops, a pie shop, a sweet shop. And a shoe shop - with a sign in the window saying there was a clearance sale. Redcar's steelworks closed down in 2015. \"There's no work around here,\" said John Mohan, a 73-year-old who spent 40 years at the steelworks. \"No nothing now. They're gonna pull all that down shortly, all the works.\" The liveliest spots along this stretch were amusement arcades - brightly lit halls filled with gaudy game machines. People, some of them carrying plastic buckets rattling with coins, would go inside. Peering in, I saw punters slot two-pence-piece after two-pence-piece into the equipment, almost robotically. RAINBOW COLORS By the time I reached Brighton, the storm - called Freya - had hit land. Waves crashed upon the pier, one of the top UK attractions in 2017, but largely shut for winter. I drove past empty playgrounds into the gloom. Brighton is a much wealthier spot than the east coast. Its residents make more money than the national average. And most of its residents voted to stay in the EU. The pier was lit up in rainbow colors, in homage to the town's aspiration to be a \"gay capital.\" It's been a free-and-easy place even since the 18th century: According to Brighton museum, Jane Austen sent one of her young characters to the town as a place where she could be \"tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\" On a winter's Tuesday in 2019, \"open mike\" night in the Western Bar was lively. Remain voter Chris Baker was worried about the hardening tone of debate in the UK. \"I think we've seen a lot of the negative stuff already, with people acting out against foreigners, and we'll get more of that,\" he said. \"We've seen some impact of people not coming here - you know, a shortage of nursing, and soon a shortage of people picking vegetables and all those summer-type jobs that English people don't want to do.\" In Cornwall, I met a farming couple, Andrew and Helen Arnold, who'd only recently told each other they voted on opposite sides in the referendum. She wanted to Leave, he voted Remain. Over tea and homemade cakes in their cozy kitchen, she asked him why he chose to stay in Europe: \"I don't like change,\" he said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Clodagh Kilcoyne</p> <p>FLOOKBURGH SANDS, England (Reuters) - The thing about an old rusty tractor, said cockle-picker Tony McClure, is that even in the sea air, it will start. </p> <p>His was parked out on the tidal flats of Flookburgh sands in Morecambe Bay in northwest England, braving the salty shallows of an unusually warm February dawn.

Although surveys show Congress is trailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the elections that begin next Thursday, the race is tightening. Gandhi, the fourth generation of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1947, picked Wayanad in Kerala as his second constituency, in addition to the family borough in the north. \"I am here to send a message that south India is important,\" he told reporters as thousands of party members lined the streets of the small town in welcome. Modi's BJP has its core base of voters in India's north and west, playing second fiddle to regional parties across the south, except for Karnataka, home to the technology hub of Bangalore. But the party has been trying build its presence in the region, especially Kerala, where the Congress and a communist party are the main players, and where Gandhi is looking to galvanize party workers through his candidacy. He was accompanied by his sister, the charismatic Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who plunged into active politics in January in another move Congress hopes will add momentum to its campaign. Gandhi said his candidacy emphasized the unity of India and contrasted with the Hindu-first vision of the nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that Modi was tied to. \"There is a feeling in south India that the way the government, RSS and Narendra Modi are working... many people in the country feel that their culture, language and history are under attack,\" he added. Kerala has a significant population of Muslims and Christians in a predominantly Hindu India. Muslims form nearly 27 percent of the state's population of about 33.4 million, and Christians roughly 18 percent, census figures show. Congress has accused Modi and aligned right wing groups of pursuing a partisan agenda of attacking Muslims and changing school textbooks in efforts to shape the national identity to reflect their view, that India is a nation of, and for, Hindus. The BJP denies bias against Muslims, but says it opposes appeasement of any community. Muslims account for 14 percent of India's population of more than 1.2 billion, which is almost 80 percent Hindu, census data shows. Gandhi is also running from Amethi, in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which sent his father, former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi to parliament, as well as his grandmother Indira Gandhi, another former prime minister. Indian election rules allow candidates to run for more than one seat in parliament. But the BJP was quick to attack Gandhi for running in two constituencies, saying he was not sure he would win. However, Modi himself ran from two constituencies in the 2014 election, Varanasi in the north and Vadodara in his western home state of Gujarat, carrying both.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Subrat Patnaik</p> <p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi filed his papers on Thursday to run for parliament from a southern constituency, aiming to strengthen his Congress party's prospects in a region where the ruling Hindu nationalists have a limited presence. </p> <p>Although surveys show Congress is trailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the elections that begin next Thursday, the race is tightening.</p> <p>Gandhi, the fourth generation of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1947, picked Wayanad in Kerala as his second constituency, in addition to the family borough in the north.</p> <p>\"I am here to send a message that south India is important,\" he told reporters as thousands of party members lined the streets of the small town in welcome. </p> <p>Modi's BJP has its core base of voters in India's north and west, playing second fiddle to regional parties across the south, except for Karnataka, home to the technology hub of Bangalore.</p> <p>But the party has been trying build its presence in the region, especially Kerala, where the Congress and a communist party are the main players, and where Gandhi is looking to galvanize party workers through his candidacy.</p> <p>He was accompanied by his sister, the charismatic Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who plunged into active politics in January in another move Congress hopes will add momentum to its campaign.</p> <p>Gandhi said his candidacy emphasized the unity of India and contrasted with the Hindu-first vision of the nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that Modi was tied to.</p> <p>\"There is a feeling in south India that the way the government, RSS and Narendra Modi are working... many people in the country feel that their culture, language and history are under attack,\" he added.</p> <p>Kerala has a significant population of Muslims and Christians in a predominantly Hindu India.

Das and Rupam Jain NEW DELHI (Reuters) - If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins this spring's general election, as is widely expected, it will also be another massive victory for the marketing machine created to amplify Brand Modi into every Indian living room. Opinion polls regularly show Modi is India's most popular politician, and to turn that appeal into votes, his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pulled out all the stops from the most modern methods of communication to the very traditional. There is the recently launched \"NaMo TV\" dedicated to the 68-year-old leader, a Narendra Modi mobile app the party says has been downloaded by 100 million people, and a massive social media following across every major platform in India. Modi and the BJP have a combined 57.5 million followers on Twitter, four times the total for the main opposition Congress party and its president Rahul Gandhi. Modi is the world's third-most-followed politician on Twitter after former U.S. President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump. The Hindu nationalist BJP itself claims to have more members than any other political party in the world. Polls for the world's biggest democratic vote open on a rolling basis between April 11 and May 19. Modi is widely expected to be in a position to form a new government after the election, according to pollsters, with the big question whether he will win an outright majority or be forced into trying to form a coalition. With the campaign now in full swing, the BJP says Modi physically reaches out to more than 250,000 people a day through the many rallies he addresses. Most of those are then carried live across multiple party platforms and news channels across India, including the nation's public broadcaster. \"He is doing three to four rallies every day. One rally would cover three to four constituencies,\" said Vijay Chauthaiwale, who is in charge of BJP's foreign affairs department. Last Sunday 10 million people watched a TV program in which Modi interacted with the country's security guards, he added. Opposition parties have complained the BJP is gaining an unfair advantage by using the state broadcaster and the NaMo TV to air its propaganda. The BJP has denied the accusations but the Election Commission has said it's looking into the complaints. EARLY START On Wednesday alone, Modi addressed as many as four rallies, starting early in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh and ending late in a constituency 2,300 km (1429 miles) away in the western state of Maharashtra. Gandhi spoke in three rallies, all in the northeast. Even before the election dates were announced on March 10, Modi went on a spree to launch various public projects across more than 16 states, often using those events to broadcast the achievements of his government. \"The opposition is way behind the curve,\" said a close aide to Modi who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak with reporters. \"Even before the official inauguration of the political campaign on March 28, he completed the first phase of campaigning. Now it's the second phase.\" Congress accuses Modi and the BJP of misusing its powers and deep pockets to try and influence voters. “Modi used public projects, government-sponsored events as a vehicle to serve his political campaigning,\" Congress's chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said. \"We know the voters understand this strategy and they will make the right choice of defeating his party.” LACKING HELICOPTERS Congress also complained in January that it was struggling to find enough helicopters to ferry its leaders because the BJP had reserved most of the available aircraft well in advance. [nL3N1ZN3HY] The BJP has indeed substantially increased its income and party membership in the past five years in power. In 2017/18, the BJP’s total income including donations stood at 10.27 billion rupees ($150 million) compared with 1.9 billion rupees for Congress, according to the Association for Democratic Reforms, a Delhi-based advocacy group that examines political funding and candidate disclosure forms. \"There's a huge gap between our campaign and their (Congress) campaign,\" BJP spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal said. \"We're much ahead in our communication, on organisational structure, outreach schemes etc.\" ($1 = 68.4550 Indian rupees)","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Krishna N.

The 20-year-old, whose family fled civil war in Afghanistan for Iran during the 1990s, worried about her safety. But nearly 50 people watched the unadvertised concert by Hussaini's rock group, Azadi, in the city's Kart-e-Char neighborhood in March, singing and clapping along with the music. \"Some were against this concert, but we did not give up,\" she said. \"We are all scared of suicide bombings, explosions, abductions and other issues in this country.\" Hussaini's concert was unusual both for its public setting and the positive response it received in a country where views on women and entertainment are often ultra-conservative. In sharp contrast, a video surfaced this week and was widely shared on social media showing men whipping a woman, purportedly a Taliban punishment for singing in public. It was not clear when the video was filmed, but it generated fierce online criticism of the Taliban. Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the video. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he could not confirm the video depicted members of the group, and that it was investigating the incident. Intensifying peace talks between the United States and the Taliban have brought a focus on the place of women in Afghan society. Many say they fear greater freedoms won in recent years will be eroded under a settlement with the Islamists. The Taliban banned women from playing music or appearing in public with their faces visible when in power from 1996 to 2001. One symbol of the changes since the Taliban were overthrown is 18-year-old Zahra Elham, who last month became the first woman to win the vote-in singing competition Afghan Star in the 14 years since local TV station Tolo began screening the popular show modeled on American Idol. \"They finally supported a girl. That day, I witnessed that there is justice, they let a girl move forward,\" she said. Not everyone celebrated her success, however, said Elham, who recalled a frightening 2-km (1.2-mile) walk home from the TV studio one night in January, as her celebrity grew. \"Everyone was taunting me on the way,\" said Elham, who hails from the Hazara ethnic minority that has long suffered discrimination in Afghanistan. \"There were comments about ethnicity since, in our tribe, it is not desired for a girl to become a singer. Now my fear has increased.\" #MYREDLINE TV journalist Farahnaz Forotan, 26, received a more supportive reaction when she launched last month a social media movement with the hashtag \"MyRedLine\", encouraging women - and men - to publicly declare what rights they would not surrender. Forotan launched the movement by declaring that her pen, symbolic of her profession, was her red line. Since the Taliban government fell in 2001, a robust media industry has emerged in Afghanistan, including many female journalists. Forotan's personal RedLine video has been viewed nearly 12,000 times on Facebook. She is planning visits to all 34 Afghan provinces to expand her campaign. \"I thought that we were at a more sensitive and historic situation than any other time in the past and this sensitive and historic situation needs historic deeds,\" she said. Supporters recorded short smartphone videos of themselves declaring their own \"red lines\", including a female lawyer citing her work defending women's rights. \"We emphasize that we won't go back,\" Forotan said, referring to the Taliban era. Meanwhile Hussaini, who still lives in Iran, is already planning two more Afghan street concerts, one in Bamiyan province and another in Kabul. \"I see a good future in Afghanistan and am hopeful that street concerts will become more common here,\" she said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Orooj Hakimi</p> <p>KABUL (Reuters) - Soria Hussaini was not sure what would happen when she decided to perform the first Kabul street concert by a woman in recent memory. </p> <p>The 20-year-old, whose family fled civil war in Afghanistan for Iran during the 1990s, worried about her safety.

Saudi Arabia has engaged in \"many deeply troubling actions and statements that have provoked alarm in Congress,\" Senators Bob Menendez, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, told Perry in a letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The senators said Congress was beginning to reevaluate the U.S.-Saudi relationship, and they believe Washington should not be providing nuclear technology or information to Saudi Arabia now. The Trump administration has been quietly negotiating a deal that would potentially help Saudi Arabia build two reactors. Last week news reports revealed that since November 2017, Perry has authorized so-called Part 810 approvals allowing U.S. companies to share sensitive nuclear information with the kingdom. The approvals were kept from the public and from Congress. The senators asked Perry to provide them by April 10 with the names of the companies that got the 810 approvals, what was in the authorizations, and why the companies asked that the approvals be kept secret. U.S. Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat, also asked the Energy Department in a separate letter what was in the approvals. While 810 agreements are routine, the Obama administration made them available for the public to read at Energy Department headquarters. Lawmakers say the department is legally required to inform Congress about the approvals. Perry approved the seven recent authorizations as the administration has tried to hash out nonproliferation standards with Saudi Arabia. Such a pact, known as a 123 agreement, would have to be agreed before U.S. companies can share physical exports of materials and equipment to build reactors. The kingdom has resisted standards on reprocessing spent fuel and enriching uranium, two potential paths to making nuclear weapons. The United States has been competing with South Korea, France, Russia and China on a potential deal to help build reactors in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is expected to announce the winner this year. Lawmakers from both parties have been concerned about Saudi Arabia's bombing campaigns in Yemen, which is on the brink of famine, and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Concern in Congress grew last year after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS that \"Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\" Perry has said the 810 approvals were kept from the public for corporate proprietary reasons. He has also said that if Saudi Arabia relies on China or Russia for building nuclear reactors those two countries don't give a \"tinker's damn\" about non-proliferation. Many non-proliferation experts dispute the notion that a deal with China or Russia would be riskier. These people say the United States has many other levers it can pull to influence nuclear behavior. At another Senate hearing, the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including Chairman Kristine Svinicki, would not say whether the NRC raised any concerns over the 810 approvals in a required consultation with the Energy Department. Svinicki said the NRC's consulting role on the approvals is narrow and delegated to staff. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat who asked the question of the NRC at the hearing, told Reuters in an interview that the commissioners' lack of knowledge about the approvals was \"stunning.\" \"It's kind of scary because we do rely on them to provide input into this process and not a single commissioner knew anything about what input they may or may not have provided.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Timothy Gardner</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators from both parties on Tuesday asked Energy Secretary Rick Perry for details about recent approvals for companies to share nuclear energy information with Saudi Arabia, with the lawmakers expressing concern about possible development of atomic weapons.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has engaged in \"many deeply troubling actions and statements that have provoked alarm in Congress,\" Senators Bob Menendez, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, told Perry in a letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. </p> <p>The senators said Congress was beginning to reevaluate the U.S.-Saudi relationship, and they believe Washington should not be providing nuclear technology or information to Saudi Arabia now.</p> <p>The Trump administration has been quietly negotiating a deal that would potentially help Saudi Arabia build two reactors. </p> <p>Last week news reports revealed that since November 2017, Perry has authorized so-called Part 810 approvals allowing U.S. companies to share sensitive nuclear information with the kingdom.

U.S. Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat, also asked the Energy Department in a separate letter what was in the approvals. </p> <p>While 810 agreements are routine, the Obama administration made them available for the public to read at Energy Department headquarters.

The new criminal probation terms for PG&E are modest compared with ones the judge had in mind in January and that PG&E said could have cost upwards of $150 billion. The terms will, however, keep PG&E under the supervision of Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and hold the company, which also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, to its target for clearing areas around its power lines of some 375,000 trees this year. PG&E's probation stems from its felony conviction after a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline blast in San Bruno, California, near San Francisco, that killed eight people and injured 58 others. PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29 in anticipation of liabilities from wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze, the Camp Fire. It killed 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. At a January hearing, Alsup, who is overseeing PG&E's probation, said he felt compelled to propose additional probation terms in the aftermath of Camp Fire. San Francisco-based PG&E expects its equipment will be found to have caused the blaze. The probation process is separate from San Francisco-based PG&E's bankruptcy. As the company faces $30 billion in wildfire liabilities and bankruptcy proceedings, the energy company is expected to name as its new chief executive Bill Johnson, a source said on Tuesday. Johnson has been the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority since 2013 and is retiring on Friday. Additional probation terms imposed by Alsup on Tuesday will require PG&E to meet goals in a wildfire mitigation plan it unveiled in February. The goals include removing 375,000 dead, dying or hazardous trees from areas at high risk of wildfires in 2019, compared with 160,000 last year. The judge said PG&E will not be able to pay shareholders until it complies with his new probation terms. Shares fell 2% on Tuesday to close at $17.66 on the New York Stock Exchange and are down 63% since November 2018 due to concerns about the company's bankruptcy and wildfire liabilities. The shares traded as low as $5.07 in January. PG&E in December 2017 suspended its quarterly cash dividend, citing uncertainty about liabilities from wildfires in October of that year that struck Northern California. PG&E paid $798 million in dividends in 2017 and $925 million in 2016, a period in which the company did a poor job of clearing areas around its power lines of hazardous trees, according to Alsup. Money meant for shareholders should have been spent on efforts to reduce wildfire risks in recent years, Alsup said at Tuesday's hearing. \"PG&E has started way more than its share of these fires,\" Alsup said. \"I want to see the people of California safe,\" the judge added. Lawyers for PG&E did not contest the new terms, which the company considers more feasible than terms Alsup proposed in January. To comply with the terms Alsup proposed in January, PG&E said it would have to remove 100 million trees. The company added that shutting power lines during high winds as Alsup proposed would not be feasible because the lines traverse rural areas to service cities and suburbs. Idling lines could also affect the power grid in other states, PG&E said. Alsup on Tuesday said he was still considering his proposal to require PG&E to shut down power lines during windy weather to prevent tree branches from making contact and sparking fires.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jim Christie</p> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Tuesday that PG&E Corp cannot resume dividends and must use the money to reduce wildfire risk in California, stopping short of more costly measures he proposed earlier this year.</p> <p>The new criminal probation terms for PG&E are modest compared with ones the judge had in mind in January and that PG&E said could have cost upwards of $150 billion.</p> <p>The terms will, however, keep PG&E under the supervision of Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and hold the company, which also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, to its target for clearing areas around its power lines of some 375,000 trees this year.</p> <p>PG&E's probation stems from its felony conviction after a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline blast in San Bruno, California, near San Francisco, that killed eight people and injured 58 others.</p> <p>PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29 in anticipation of liabilities from wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze, the Camp Fire.

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission released the report at the start of a three-day hearing focused on whether Wynn Resorts remains suitable to retain a license needed to run a $2.6-billion casino just outside Boston it plans to open in June. Wynn has called the sexual misconduct accusations \"preposterous.\" His lawyer had no immediate comment on Tuesday. The report by the commission's investigations and enforcement bureau followed a January 2018 article by The Wall Street Journal detailing allegations that the billionaire had engaged in a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct. His subsequent exit as the company's chief executive and sale of his 11.8-percent stake in the company made him one of the most prominent corporate executives to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted longstanding patterns of sexual harassment and abuse in major U.S. institutions. Wynn Resorts said in a Tuesday statement it arranged for Wynn to leave without severance, cooperated with the Massachusetts inquiry and has parted ways with any employee who did not investigate or report allegations against Wynn. Wynn Resorts shares were up 1.9 percent at $131.85. Massachusetts investigators concluded that over several years, a limited group of executives and employees disregarded company policies when it came to allegations of sexual misconduct against Wynn involving other employees. The 199-page report said certain executives, with the help of outside lawyers, also took steps after learning about allegations against Wynn to conceal them. \"Their efforts at secrecy made it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for gaming regulators to detect this potentially derogatory information through typical regulatory means,\" the report said.

The Fed, Moore wrote in the Wall Street Journal here earlier this month, should take a page from the playbook of Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman who battled back rampant inflation in the early 1980s. According to Moore, Volcker's success was rooted in his use of a commodity-price rule that prompted the Fed to lift interest rates when commodity prices were rising and cut them when they were falling. One problem: It appears Volcker and the Fed never used such a system. In the 1980s \"there was some discussion of this and some board members paid some attention to commodity prices,\" Donald Kohn, a Fed staffer through most of Volcker's tenure and eventually a vice chair of the Fed himself, told Reuters. \"But it did not play a central role.\" A review of Fed transcripts from that era shows months going by without commodities being mentioned at all at policy meetings. In cases when they were discussed they were cast as just another bit of data, not as a core anchor for policy. And in Volcker's recent book \"Keeping At It,\" which includes an account of the inflation war, he never mentions a commodity index. Volcker did not respond to a request for comment left with an aide at his nonprofit organization. Moore did not respond to repeated interview requests through the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank where he is a distinguished visiting fellow. His Journal column, which lambastes the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates at the end of last year, appeared on March 13 and was shown to Trump by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, a friend of Moore's, according to Bloomberg and the Washington Post. Trump, who has been a harsh critic of the Fed's rate increases and of Powell, whom he appointed Fed chair, lauded the article and last week said he would nominate Moore to one of two vacancies on the Fed board. Although his name has not yet been formally submitted to the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation, Trump's promise to nominate Moore has been met with criticism from economists across the political spectrum. It potentially also ends any sense of truce between Trump and the Fed, placing an ardent partisan on Powell’s board even as the Fed put the recent round of rate hikes on hold. LOOSE LANGUAGE Use of a commodity index to set monetary policy was pushed in the 1980s by the supply-side economists and politicians who were influential in the Reagan administration years and saw commodities as a sort of stand-in for the gold standard, which the U.S. government abandoned in the 1970s. That included Arthur Laffer, a member of Reagan's economic team and Moore's mentor. The two co-wrote a 2010 book, \"Return to Prosperity,\" that also mentions Volcker's purported adoption of a monetary rule based on commodities. George Selgin, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, where Moore worked in the 1990s, said in a blog post here this week that Moore's and Laffer's assertions about Volcker and commodities were not grounded in fact. \"(D)espite what Stephen Moore has written, there's no evidence that either Paul Volcker or any later Fed chair ever deliberately 'linked Fed monetary policy to real-time changes in commodity prices,'\" Selgin wrote. Like many others who have reviewed the commodity price targeting idea, Kohn, the former Fed vice chair and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the notion of tying Fed policy to commodity prices overlooks the uncertain connection between those prices and the general rate of inflation that the Fed tries to control. Moreover, it could tie the U.S. central bank to an index that could fluctuate wildly on the basis of trade war tariffs or Chinese demand for copper.

Moore, he said, \"is being loose and careless in language.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Howard Schneider</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the op-ed column that may vault think tank analyst Stephen Moore to a spot on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, he argues the Fed could have skirted recent rate hikes and dodged a wave of criticism by tying monetary policy to commodity prices.</p> <p>The Fed, Moore wrote in the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-is-a-threat-to-growth-11552518464\">here</a> earlier this month, should take a page from the playbook of Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman who battled back rampant inflation in the early 1980s. According to Moore, Volcker's success was rooted in his use of a commodity-price rule that prompted the Fed to lift interest rates when commodity prices were rising and cut them when they were falling.</p> <p>One problem: It appears Volcker and the Fed never used such a system.</p> <p>In the 1980s \"there was some discussion of this and some board members paid some attention to commodity prices,\" Donald Kohn, a Fed staffer through most of Volcker's tenure and eventually a vice chair of the Fed himself, told Reuters. \"But it did not play a central role.\" </p> <p>A review of Fed transcripts from that era shows months going by without commodities being mentioned at all at policy meetings. In cases when they were discussed they were cast as just another bit of data, not as a core anchor for policy.</p> <p>And in Volcker's recent book \"Keeping At It,\" which includes an account of the inflation war, he never mentions a commodity index. Volcker did not respond to a request for comment left with an aide at his nonprofit organization. </p> <p>Moore did not respond to repeated interview requests through the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank where he is a distinguished visiting fellow. </p> <p>His Journal column, which lambastes the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates at the end of last year, appeared on March 13 and was shown to Trump by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, a friend of Moore's, according to Bloomberg and the Washington Post. Trump, who has been a harsh critic of the Fed's rate increases and of Powell, whom he appointed Fed chair, lauded the article and last week said he would nominate Moore to one of two vacancies on the Fed board.</p> <p>Although his name has not yet been formally submitted to the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation, Trump's promise to nominate Moore has been met with criticism from economists across the political spectrum.</p> <p>It potentially also ends any sense of truce between Trump and the Fed, placing an ardent partisan on Powell’s board even as the Fed put the recent round of rate hikes on hold. </p> <p></p> <p>LOOSE LANGUAGE</p> <p>Use of a commodity index to set monetary policy was pushed in the 1980s by the supply-side economists and politicians who were influential in the Reagan administration years and saw commodities as a sort of stand-in for the gold standard, which the U.S. government abandoned in the 1970s. </p> <p>That included Arthur Laffer, a member of Reagan's economic team and Moore's mentor. The two co-wrote a 2010 book, \"Return to Prosperity,\" that also mentions Volcker's purported adoption of a monetary rule based on commodities.</p> <p>George Selgin, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, where Moore worked in the 1990s, said in a blog post <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/stephen-moores-other-volcker-rule\">here</a> this week that Moore's and Laffer's assertions about Volcker and commodities were not grounded in fact.</p> <p>\"(D)espite what Stephen Moore has written, there's no evidence that either Paul Volcker or any later Fed chair ever deliberately 'linked Fed monetary policy to real-time changes in commodity prices,'\" Selgin wrote.</p> <p>Like many others who have reviewed the commodity price targeting idea, Kohn, the former Fed vice chair and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the notion of tying Fed policy to commodity prices overlooks the uncertain connection between those prices and the general rate of inflation that the Fed tries to control.</p> <p>Moreover, it could tie the U.S. central bank to an index that could fluctuate wildly on the basis of trade war tariffs or Chinese demand for copper.</p> <p>The Fed in fact emphasizes core price readings that strip out energy and food on the view measures excluding such volatile commodities are a more reliable indicator of underlying inflation. </p> <p>Wayne Angell, the Fed board member from that era most focused on commodity prices, later acknowledged in a 1992 article for the Cato Journal that while commodity prices \"yield useful information,\" they are \"not perfect monetary indicators and should be neither the sole indicator nor the target for monetary policy.\"</p> <p>Moore's columns may have caught the president’s eye, but critics, including some at the organizations where Moore studied and developed his career, say his loose use of language is a drawback in a technical setting like the Fed.</p> <p>\"If I was someone in Congress I would be very concerned,\" with the concept Moore laid out, said David Beckworth, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where Moore received his masters degree in economics. </p> <p>\"It could be destabilizing,\" Beckworth said, with so many world prices now hinging, for example, on Chinese demand.</p> <p>Moore, he said, \"is being loose and careless in language.\" </p> <p></p>","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-moore/trumps-fed-pick-advocates-return-to-a-rule-that-may-never-have-existed-idUSKCN1R92IR","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:44:47Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Politics","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/politicsNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"Wall Street treads water after rally, Walgreens slumps on profit warning","datePublished":"2019-04-02T11:36:48","datePublishedRaw":"April 2, 2019 / 11:36 AM / 2 days ago","author":"https://www.reuters.com/journalists/april-joyner","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190402&t=2&i=1372739250&r=LYNXNPEF310XZ","description":"The benchmark S&P 500 stock index paused on Tuesday, taking a breather from Monday's strong quarterly kickoff as a decline in shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc weighed and economic data did little to ease growth concerns.","articleBody":"By April Joyner NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 stock index paused on Tuesday, taking a breather from Monday's strong quarterly kickoff as a decline in shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc weighed and economic data did little to ease growth concerns. Walgreens shares slumped 12.8% after the drugstore chain cut its 2019 profit growth forecast and reported a quarterly profit that missed analyst estimates. The S&P 500 consumer staples index, which includes Walgreens, dropped 0.8%. Shares of rival drugstore company CVS Health Corp fell 3.8%. Shares of drug wholesalers AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp also slid. Walgreens shares weighed the most on all three of Wall Street's major indexes. CVS and the drug wholesalers were also among the biggest drags on the S&P 500. The Nasdaq moved higher, however, as shares of Facebook Inc jumped 3.3%. Data showing that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods slipped in February and that shipments were flat did little to lift tepid investor sentiment. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, or core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.1%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it to remain unchanged. The data comes on the heels of a survey showing a surprise rebound in China's manufacturing activity and better-than-expected U.S. numbers, which drove the S&P 500 to near six-month highs on Monday. \"We're still seeing mixed signals in terms of economic data,\" said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.

Ghosn, widely lauded for rescuing Nissan Motor Co from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago, has experienced a dramatic fall from grace that shook the global auto industry and raised questions about the future of Nissan's alliance with France's Renault SA. He was arrested in Tokyo in November and faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the financial crisis. Released on $9 million bail last month, Ghosn has denied the charges, calling them \"meritless\" and saying he was the victim of a boardroom coup. \"I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11,\" Ghosn tweeted from the @carlosghosn account on Twitter, which displayed the blue tick mark indicating it had been verified by the social media site. The account was created this month. It was the sole tweet, posted in Japanese and English. While Ghosn is under strict bail terms - including on internet usage - his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters the tweet did not violate those terms. Hironaka also said there had been no requests from Tokyo prosecutors, after Japan's Yomiuri newspaper and other media outlets reported authorities were preparing a fresh case against Ghosn over payments the automaker made to a business partner in Oman. FRESH CHARGES? Prosecutors are in discussions with the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and others and plan to make a decision soon on whether to prosecute Ghosn on further charges of aggravated breach of trust, the newspaper said, citing sources involved in the case. A spokesman for the Tokyo prosecutors office said he was not aware of any new investigation when contacted by Reuters. Ghosn's spokesman has previously said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Oman firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by Ghosn and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt, the spokesman said. Sources told Reuters earlier this week that Renault had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was chief executive of the French automaker. Nissan had previously established its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Oman distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA). Evidence sent to French prosecutors late last week showed that much of the cash was subsequently channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said. Reuters has not been able to reach SBA for comment on the matter.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Kenneth Maxwell and Tim Kelly</p> <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn promised to \"tell the truth\" at a news conference next week, taking to Twitter to announce his first briefing since being released on bail and hours after a report that prosecutors were preparing a fresh case against him.</p> <p>Ghosn, widely lauded for rescuing Nissan Motor Co from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago, has experienced a dramatic fall from grace that shook the global auto industry and raised questions about the future of Nissan's alliance with France's Renault SA.</p> <p>He was arrested in Tokyo in November and faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the financial crisis.</p> <p>Released on $9 million bail last month, Ghosn has denied the charges, calling them \"meritless\" and saying he was the victim of a boardroom coup.</p> <p>\"I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening.

The policy, embraced by Trump in the wake of an October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas in which bump stocks were used, went into effect on Tuesday. The ban is a rare recent instance of gun control at the federal level in a country that has experienced a succession of mass shootings. The court in a brief order refused to grant a temporary stay sought by the group Gun Owners of America and others in a lawsuit filed in Michigan challenging the ban while litigation continues. Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday rejected a similar bid to block the policy in a separate legal challenge brought in Washington by individual gun owners and gun rights groups including the Firearms Policy Foundation and Florida Carry Inc. Michael Hammond, Gun Owners of America's legislative counsel, said many owners of the estimated 500,000 bump stocks in the United States would refuse to turn them in despite the ban and related criminal penalties. People caught in possession of bump stocks could face up to 10 years in prison under the policy. \"GOA will continue to fight the issue in the court system, as the case now returns to the lower courts. We remain convinced that the courts will consign this unlawful, unconstitutional ban to the trash bin of history, where it belongs,\" Hammond said in a statement, using the group's acronym. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the administration was pleased with the high court's action. Bump stocks use a gun's recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform it into a machine gun. The Justice Department's regulation followed the lead of many states and retailers that imposed stricter limits on sales of guns and accessories after a deadly shooting at a Florida high school in February 2018. LAS VEGAS SHOOTING Trump pledged to ban bump stocks soon after a gunman used them in a spree that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas. The Justice Department on Dec. 18 announced plans to implement the policy on March 26. The FBI said in January it had found no clear motive for the 64-year-old Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. In the Michigan case, a federal judge already has ruled in favor of the administration. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to put the ban on hold pending appeal. Other plaintiffs in that case include the Gun Owners Foundation, the Virginia Citizens Defense League and three individual gun owners. In the Washington case, a federal judge also upheld the ban, prompting the gun rights advocates to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court has heard oral arguments but has not yet ruled. Those challenging the policy have argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) lacks the authority to equate bump stocks with machine guns. One of the laws at the center of the legal dispute was written more than 80 years ago, when Congress restricted access to machine guns during the heyday of American gangsters' use of \"tommy guns.\" Trump's fellow Republicans typically oppose gun control measures and favor of a broad interpretation of the right to bear arms promised in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. In 2017, there were 39,773 gun deaths in the United States, according to the most recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures released in December.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Lawrence Hurley</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday handed President Donald Trump a victory by rejecting for the second time in three days a bid by gun rights activists to block his new ban on \"bump stock\" attachments that enable semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly.</p> <p>The policy, embraced by Trump in the wake of an October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas in which bump stocks were used, went into effect on Tuesday.

It was not known what topics were discussed with Kushner, who is involved in developing an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and has helped forged closer U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia. The committee has been conducting a largely bipartisan investigation of suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the nature of contacts between Trump campaign members and Russian officials, including Kushner. A spokesman for Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senator Mark Warner, the panel's Democratic Vice Chairman declined to comment. Senators and staff investigators were present at the meeting with Kushner in a Senate office building, the congressional sources said. Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, had previously appeared before the panel in July 2017. Only staff investigators were present at that session, according to news reports at the time. Committee investigators are working on a five-chapter final report on Russian political activities targeted at the United States and American responses to them. Russia denies interfering in the election. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow meddled to undermine the U.S. democratic process and help Trump get elected. U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday released his four-page summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a 22-month investigation into Russian interference in 2016. Barr said Mueller did not establish that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the campaign.

Israel was founded by the left, which dominated politics in the early years of the state. In 1992 it took 61 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament. Nearly 30 years on, the left is forecast to take only around 25 seats in an election on Tuesday. The left has been reeling after a series of setbacks - the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, the failure of his 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to deliver peace with the Palestinians, many rounds of failed negotiations and years of bloodshed that have made both sides bitter and mistrustful. Now, only 12 percent of Jewish Israelis identify themselves as left-wing, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. It was around double that a decade-and-a-half ago. Fifty-six percent now describe themselves as right-wing, up from 40 percent over the same period, and the amount who say they are centrists is little changed at 26.5 percent. With Netanyahu in power for the past decade and months away from becoming Israel's longest-serving leader if he is re-elected, the right is on the ascendant. The only candidate with a chance of beating Netanyahu is not a leftist. Benny Gantz, a former general and political novice, belongs to a new party that is running on a centrist platform. Seeking to win over right-leaning voters, Gantz, 59, has highlighted his military credentials and is a pragmatist. Gantz was head of the Israeli military during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in which 2,100 Palestinians were killed, against an Israeli death toll of 67 soldiers and six civilians. Gantz embraces that legacy, running a television ad which highlighted the number of Palestinian militants killed on his watch. Careful not to alienate centrist voters, Gantz also chooses his words carefully on the issue that more than any other divides Israel's left and right – a \"two-state solution\" for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gantz nods to the left by saying Israel should pursue peace and end its dominion over the Palestinians but stops short of endorsing Palestinian statehood. Most polls show Gantz's centrist Blue and White party leading Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in a straight race. But they also show a Netanyahu-led alliance of all the right-wing parties is more likely to secure a majority. \"TRAITORS\" Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who will endanger Israel's security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians, which is anathema to the right. This is Netanyahu's standard play-book, say his opponents. \"The word 'left' is a tool to delegitimize everyone or anyone who's against Netanyahu,\" said Labour lawmaker Merav Michaeli. \"'Left' has become like a curse, so it's not surprising that so many people are trying to avoid it.\" \"If there is really deep damage our prime minister has done to society, it's making the left-wingers traitors,\" said Labour supporter Liat Arbel. \"We are as (much a) part of Israel as right-wingers.\" In the build-up to the election, Netanyahu struck an alliance with anti-Arab and far-right politicians, some of whom seek to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Foremost among Netanyahu's critics for veering further right is the last left-winger to beat him in an election, Ehud Barak. Like Gantz, Barak is a former military man. Now retired from politics, Barak, 77, says the far-right has become the driving force in Israeli politics, \"like the tail wagging the dog.\" The left, he says, has lost steam. \"The left used to have a vision for Israel - a modern, Zionist, enlightened society on the cutting edge of the advanced world,\" said Barak, who was prime minister from July 1999 until March 2001. \"The right-wing has its own vision which is, in a way, dark, ultra-nationalist, somewhat racist and messianic. But it's a burning vision - so it motivates them.\" Historian Gadi Taub, of Hebrew University's School of Public Policy, describes himself as a former leftist. He says the left has become elitist, over-critical of their own society, and out of touch with mainstream Israelis, who are deeply skeptical about prospects for peace with Palestinians. \"The Israeli public is pragmatic. It drew its conclusions from the failure of the left's vision and it changed direction,\" said Taub. NO PEACE For many Israelis, Barak played a big role in the left's decline. In 2000, he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat failed to agree a peace accord. \"From that day onwards the Israeli public believed that there was no partner, that 'they' don’t want peace,\" said Angela Godfrey-Goldstein, a veteran Israeli peace activist. \"Israelis hunkered down.\" The outbreak of a Palestinian intifada, or uprising, a few months later drove the sides even further apart. Palestinians carried out shootings and suicide bombings, and Israel carried out air strikes and army raids. Opinion was further hardened when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, only for Hamas to seize control of the territory two years later, further dimming prospects for peace. If he is to secure victory, Gantz may have to convince voters he is in the model of former commanders turned politicians, such as Rabin and Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister from March 2001 until April 2006. Gantz was asked about the comparison with Rabin at an election event in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. \"To be compared to Yitzhak Rabin would be nothing short of the best compliment I can think of,\" he replied. \"Rabin was center, a bit left, a bit right, however you want to define him.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Maayan Lubell</p> <p>TEL AVIV (Reuters) - When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to undermine his strongest election challenger, he pins a label on him that many Israelis see as an insult: \"Leftist\".</p> <p>Israel was founded by the left, which dominated politics in the early years of the state.

The ruling, which a lead prosecutor confirmed on television news channels, promises to further polarize a dispute between MMG and the Quechua-speaking village of Fuerabamba, in Peru's southern copper belt. Villagers have demanded that their lawyers be freed before talking with the government about lifting their blockades of two roads that have cut off access to the Las Bambas mine, halting its exports. \"I hope that the community understands we're not against them. We're against crime,\" prosecutor Jorge Chavez Cotrina said in comments broadcast on local TV channel RPP. \"They can ask for whatever they want. But we have to act according to the law.\" The prosecution argued the lawyers - the brothers Jorge and Frank Chavez, and Carlos Vargas - had manipulated Fuerabamba villagers into blocking a road used by Las Bambas to extort MMG, and must be held in jail because they are a flight risk. Kevin Pena, the attorney for the three men, denied the accusations and said their due process was being violated. Fuerabamba villagers have repeatedly denied that they were manipulated by the lawyers, saying they fairly represented them in their claim for compensation from MMG for transporting its copper concentrates on a road that passes through the community's farmland. At the end of a three-day hearing in the regional capital of Cusco, Judge Patricia Valencia granted the prosecution's request to order the lawyers to 36 months in pre-trial detention while prosecutors prepare charges against them. Fuerabamba villager Edison Vargas said the community would continue the blockades while they remained in jail. \"We'll keep up the struggle 36 months. The mine will be shuttered 36 months,\" Vargas said in a phone message. Fuerabamba's president, Gregorio Rojas, could not immediately be reached for comment. MMG has said it is open to dialogue. Las Bambas, MMG's flagship mine, is one of Peru's biggest copper producers, churning out about 400,000 tonnes in copper per year, or about 2 percent of global supply. Only some 900 workers out of 1,900 remained at the mine on Wednesday, and more will be evacuated by helicopter in coming days, a company source told Reuters. Production at Las Bambas \"continues at progressively reduced rates,\" the company said in an emailed statement from its headquarters in Australia. \"The situation at the site remains unchanged, inbound and outbound logistics are suspended.\" MMG is controlled by state-owned China Minmetals.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino</p> <p>LIMA (Reuters) - A Peruvian judge on Wednesday ordered three years of jail time for three lawyers representing indigenous villagers who have blockaded shipments from a massive copper mine operated by Chinese miner MMG Ltd.</p> <p>The ruling, which a lead prosecutor confirmed on television news channels, promises to further polarize a dispute between MMG and the Quechua-speaking village of Fuerabamba, in Peru's southern copper belt.</p> <p>Villagers have demanded that their lawyers be freed before talking with the government about lifting their blockades of two roads that have cut off access to the Las Bambas mine, halting its exports.</p> <p>\"I hope that the community understands we're not against them.

The video, which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip-up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world's third-largest democracy, was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re-election on April 17. The team, comprised mainly of people in their 20s, has a sleek, high-rise office in central Jakarta. On a recent visit, Reuters saw the team's data of social media activity on the Indonesian presidential election displayed on LED screens covering one wall of a conference room. Widodo's aides say the team uses the data to determine the pop-culture references that the president will make in his next speech - he's done \"Games of Thrones\" and the \"Avengers\" already - or the sneakers he might wear to an event to appeal to young voters. Widodo's sons also sometimes advise him on outfits or speeches, according to one senior campaign aide. Millennials - those aged 17-35 – account for over one third of Indonesia's 193 million voters and both Widodo and his challenger, former general Prabowo Subianto, have ramped up efforts to appeal to them. \"Just because of the sheer size of that voter base, the millennials will play an important role in deciding the direction of the election,\" said Djayadi Hanan of pollster Saiful Mujani Research & Consulting. Most opinion polls show Widodo, 57, holding a double-digit lead over his opponent. A recent survey by pollster Roy Morgan showed around 60 percent of young voters favoring Widodo, but both campaigns say that wooing the country's largely apolitical youth is a challenge. A former furniture-maker who grew up in a riverside slum and is the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite, Widodo's everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard. But since taking office, aides say, young supporters \"no longer recognized\" the president and he was advised to project a more relaxed image. \"Because he has had to become more stately, that 'village boy' narrative was missing this time,\" said the senior campaign aide, who declined to be identified. That's where the backroom team came in. \"We're able to see in real-time what does well or what people react negatively to ... We were very blunt in conveying that to the president,\" the aide said, adding that Widodo gets a summary of the social media data almost daily. JEANS AND SNEAKERS Where his rival often wears fitted suits and oxford shoes, Widodo sports a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, jeans, and brightly colored sneakers. In March, the president posted an animated comic strip on social media that showed him meeting his younger self and discussing the achievements of his government. Taking a page from Indian Prime Minister's Narendra Modi's playbook, Widodo has started using a holographic projection of himself to address voters at campaign rallies. Analysts say Prabowo is less popular among young voters, in part because of a strongman image stemming from his time as special forces chief under authoritarian ruler Suharto. Aides have suggested softening the image of the 67-year-old, so he now wears a khaki shirt and aviator sunglasses at campaign rallies. \"It was rare to see his lighter side and sense of humor. We have tried to expose that side of him,\" said campaign spokesman Dahnil Anzar. Prabowo's team has also posted a photograph of him with his cat, which was popular online. The cat now has its own Instagram account. Prabowo's running mate, businessman and amateur marathon runner Sandiaga Uno, was chosen in part for his massive appeal both online and offline with young and female voters. As the keynote speaker at a recent event for young entrepreneurs, Uno, 49, joined a group of breakdancers on stage before kicking footballs into a crowd of university students. Uno's popularity and extensive campaigning across the country has helped boost Prabowo's electability, aides say. DESPERATE PROMISES Nevertheless, many young voters want policy pledges to address job creation and youth unemployment, not campaign gimmicks. Unemployment, at about 5 percent, is one of the highest in Southeast Asia, and many of those without jobs are graduates of vocational schools. In what was widely seen as an attempt to win votes, Widodo last month promised cash benefits to graduates from poor families and the unemployed, but did not offer details. Critics questioned the feasibility of such a plan, citing an already strained national budget. Prabowo and his running mate have promised \"entrepreneurial training\" for graduates. \"Our biggest concern is how to get a job after we graduate and who is the leader who can give us that,\" said Haliza Aulia Madina, a 19-year-old student studying Arabic in the city of Bandung, who supports Prabowo.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Kanupriya Kapoor</p> <p>JAKARTA (Reuters) - \"Mama, just killed a man,\" sings Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a recent ride in a local YouTube celebrity's car while Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the background. </p> <p>The video, which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip-up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world's third-largest democracy, was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re-election on April 17. </p> <p>The team, comprised mainly of people in their 20s, has a sleek, high-rise office in central Jakarta.

Passenger-car sales suffered throughout the January-March quarter compared with the same period in 2018 as Americans continued to abandon them in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs, which are far more profitable for automakers. The battle for market share in the particularly lucrative large-pickup truck market intensified in the quarter, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV'S (FCA) Ram brand outsold the U.S.' No. 1 automaker General Motors Co's Chevrolet-brand trucks. The two automakers have both launched redesigned pickup trucks. Ford Motor Co has for decades built the single best-selling truck brand in its F-Series trucks, with the Chevy brand a solid No. 2 and Ram a distant third. In the fourth quarter, the Chevy and Ram brands were tied for second place behind Ford. GM said versions of its new Silverado pickup trucks that are already on the market rose 20 percent in the first quarter versus sales of the old model in 2018. GM said it is still ramping up production of remaining variants of the truck. Overall, U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to decline in 2019 after a long bull run since the end of the Great Recession, led by falling passenger car sales. Competition in the high-margin SUV market is intensifying. Ford on Tuesday unveiled details of the latest version of its Escape SUV, heavily emphasizing comfort features including a movable rear seat to provide more leg room for passengers, plus consumer-friendly features such as an 8-inch (20.3 cm) touchscreen and Wi-Fi connection for up to 10 devices within 50 feet (15.2m) of the vehicle. GM's first-quarter sales fell 7 percent, with declines across all brands. Sales of Silverado pickup trucks fell nearly 16 percent and the high-margin Chevy Suburban large SUV dropped 25 percent. GM and Ford do not report monthly sales. Ford is due to release its first-quarter sales figures on Thursday. According to industry data, Ford's sales fell 2 percent in the quarter and 5 percent in March. Ford representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. FCA reported a 7 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and a 3 percent drop for the first quarter. All of FCA's brands dropped in March, except for Ram, which saw a 15 percent increase in pickup truck sales. \"The industry had a tough first quarter, but with spring finally starting to show its face and continued strong economic indicators ... we are confident that new vehicle sales demand will strengthen going forward,\" FCA's U.S. head of sales, Reid Bigland, said in a statement. Toyota Motor Corp reported a 3.5 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and 5 percent for the first quarter, hurt by declining demand for its Corolla sedans and Camry vehicles. \"While some of our competitors are abandoning sedans, we remain optimistic about the future of the segment,\" Toyota said in a statement. Nissan Motor Co Ltd posted a 5.3 percent drop in sales in March, and its first-quarter sales were down 11.6 percent. Honda Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co bucked the trend. Honda's U.S. sales rose 4.3 percent in March and 2 percent in the quarter, while Hyundai's were up 1.7 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. Industry consultants J.D.

He was reacting to Prime Minister Theresa May's statement saying she would ask the EU for a further delay to the day of Brexit and would sit down with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to break the impasse in parliament. \"Even if, after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient,\" Tusk said on Twitter. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen cautiously backed Tusk but expressed doubt whether May's attempt for a cross-party compromise on Brexit, something EU officials have said May should have pursued three years ago, was to be taken seriously. \"Since we could agree to postpone Brexit to right before European Parliament election (on May 23-26) given the approval of May’s agreement, we should also be patient IF there suddenly is a cross party way forward in UK. But is it to good to believe?\" Rasmussen said on Twitter. May said the extension she would seek beyond the current legal departure day of April 12 should be \"as short as possible\" without specifying any period, and added that it should end when a deal is ratified by parliament. She did not make clear what kind of solution she would seek together with Corbyn, who supports the option of Britain staying in a customs union with the EU - something May's party rejects. EU officials who asked not to be identified said it was not clear what compromise May was trying to achieve and that was why Tusk was calling for patience. But patience has limits, the EU officials said, because on April 10 EU leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit to finalize Brexit. April 12 has already been set as the date on which Britain will leave the EU without a deal, unless a request for an extension is approved by EU leaders. \"I'm not sure what her game plan is or where it is headed,\" one EU official closely involved in the Brexit process said. \"If it’s for real that there’s now a cross-party process in the UK, everybody here will applaud it.

The question is: how successful will they be? Attorney General William Barr, who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller's report to release, sent lawmakers a four-page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller's \"principal conclusions\" and has promised to release the nearly 400-page report by the middle of this month, with some parts blacked out, or \"redacted.\" That has not satisfied Democrats, who control the House. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report, without redactions, as well as underlying evidence. Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort, important judicial precedents and Barr's rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential. CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH? Yes. Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary. If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material, the House could vote to hold him \"in contempt\" and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena. Legal experts said that process could take years. Barr's \"principal conclusions\" letter said Mueller's inquiry did not establish that Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction. The letter provided scant details of the findings, though Trump immediately claimed \"complete and total exoneration.\" The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency. House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020. A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. In 2012, the House, then controlled by Republicans, subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales, dubbed \"Fast and Furious.\" Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to comply. The House voted to hold him in contempt, marking the first time in U.S. history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president's Cabinet. The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office, with a settlement reached in 2018. WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT? Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making \"redactions that are required\" before releasing the Mueller report. He cited four reasons for redactions: protecting secret grand jury proceedings; safeguarding intelligence-gathering sources and methods; shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations; and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations. Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors. U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it. Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government. WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY? Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight. Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves \"grave hostile acts of a foreign power\" or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake. A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings. H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken \"elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials.\" The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment. If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president's interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary's need for evidence.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jan Wolfe</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and President Donald Trump's actions related to the inquiry.</p> <p>The question is: how successful will they be?</p> <p>Attorney General William Barr, who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller's report to release, sent lawmakers a four-page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller's \"principal conclusions\" and has promised to release the nearly 400-page report by the middle of this month, with some parts blacked out, or \"redacted.\"</p> <p>That has not satisfied Democrats, who control the House.

U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it.</p> <p>Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government.</p> <p></p> <p>WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY?</p> <p>Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight.</p> <p>Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves \"grave hostile acts of a foreign power\" or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake.</p> <p>A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings.</p> <p>H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken \"elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials.\" The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment. </p> <p>If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president's interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary's need for evidence.</p> <p></p> <p></p>","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-subpoena-explainer/explainer-can-democratic-subpoenas-force-the-release-of-muellers-trump-russia-report-idUSKCN1RE2GW","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:44:55Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Politics","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/politicsNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"NATO chief says Brazil, other Latin American countries could become 'partners'","datePublished":"2019-04-03T22:45:24","datePublishedRaw":"April 3, 2019 / 10:45 PM / Updated 13 hours ago","author":"https://www.reuters.com/journalists/david-brunnstrom","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190403&t=2&i=1373246948&r=LYNXNPEF321RF","description":"NATO can look at the possibility of other Latin American states joining Colombia in becoming alliance partners, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, while appearing to rule out U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Brazil could one day become a full member of the North Atlantic security body.","articleBody":"By David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NATO can look at the possibility of other Latin American states joining Colombia in becoming alliance partners, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, while appearing to rule out U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Brazil could one day become a full member of the North Atlantic security body. \"Until 2017, NATO didn’t have any partners in Latin America and then in 2017 we got our first partner, which was Colombia, and to be a close partner of NATO is something that is good for NATO and the partner country,\" the NATO leader told Reuters in an interview ahead of a NATO ministerial meeting in Washington. \"So of course, it is a possibility to look into the possibility of having also other countries in Latin America become partners which then provides a platform, a framework for close political and practical cooperation,\" he said. At a joint White House news conference last month, Trump said he had told visiting far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro he would designate Brazil a \"major non-NATO ally\" and possibly go further by supporting a campaign to make Brazil “maybe a NATO ally,” something that would imply full membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO membership is currently limited to countries of western Europe, Turkey, Canada and the United States, although NATO partner countries include Australia and New Zealand, as well as European non-members Sweden and Finland. Ask if a country such as Brazil could become a member, Stoltenberg said: \"No. Partners are not members. But partners are very close partners. We work very closely with them, practically and politically, and that’s a very good way to strengthen cooperation with NATO and countries that are not members of the alliance.\" Asked about Brazil becoming a partner, he said: \"Well someone has to propose it and it also has to be a request from Brazil, but ... we just agreed with Colombia to make Colombia a close partner with NATO and of course it’s absolutely possible to have more partners in Latin America, but it has to be an expressed wish from Latin America and of course (it’s) something we have to discuss then among the 29 allies.\" Earlier Stoltenberg addressed the U.S. Congress and delivered an impassioned defense of the partnership he called \"the most successful alliance in history,\" which has often been derided by Trump since he took office in 2017. Colombia reached an agreement in 2017 to become the only Latin American nation to join NATO as a “global partner,” a relationship short of \"ally\" status, which means it would not necessarily have to take part in collective military action. Other NATO global partners apart from those mentioned by Stoltenberg include Afghanistan, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia and Pakistan. Becoming a “major non-NATO ally” in itself implies a status upgrade that would give a country preferential access to purchases of U.S. military equipment and technology. Supporting Brazil for alliance membership would be a considerable step further, one that Trump recognized would mean he would “have to talk to a lot of people.” NATO membership is governed by Article 10 of its 1949 founding treaty, which limits invitations to European states, subject to the approval of existing members and meeting alliance criteria.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By David Brunnstrom</p> <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NATO can look at the possibility of other Latin American states joining Colombia in becoming alliance partners, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, while appearing to rule out U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Brazil could one day become a full member of the North Atlantic security body.</p> <p>\"Until 2017, NATO didn’t have any partners in Latin America and then in 2017 we got our first partner, which was Colombia, and to be a close partner of NATO is something that is good for NATO and the partner country,\" the NATO leader told Reuters in an interview ahead of a NATO ministerial meeting in Washington.</p> <p>\"So of course, it is a possibility to look into the possibility of having also other countries in Latin America become partners which then provides a platform, a framework for close political and practical cooperation,\" he said.</p> <p>At a joint White House news conference last month, Trump said he had told visiting far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro he would designate Brazil a \"major non-NATO ally\" and possibly go further by supporting a campaign to make Brazil “maybe a NATO ally,” something that would imply full membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p> <p>NATO membership is currently limited to countries of western Europe, Turkey, Canada and the United States, although NATO partner countries include Australia and New Zealand, as well as European non-members Sweden and Finland.</p> <p>Ask if a country such as Brazil could become a member, Stoltenberg said:</p> <p>\"No. Partners are not members.

The advance took diplomats and analysts by surprise, exploiting their focus on neighboring Algeria where President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday after protests, to the relieve of Western countries valuing stability there. Libya -- in trouble since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 -- is divided between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel administration allied to Khalifa Haftar. Haftar has turned into major player in the North African country, enjoying the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which see him as bulwark against Islamists. His opponents see in him a new Gaddafi. His forces control the east and recently expanded to southern Libya. Now in a new escalation Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) moved in the past days discreetly forces west with the LNA media office publishing on Wednesday videos of troops traveling on a coastal road from Benghazi, the main eastern city. In the evening a brief skirmish lasting one hour was reported near Gharyan, a town south of Tripoli between the LNA and forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, who relied on patches of armed groups with flexible loyalties. \"Right now they are clashes south of Tripoli...in Gharyan,\" LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told al-Arabiya channel. No casualty figures were or details were immediately available. There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli government, which had issued earlier a general alert for its forces in response to the eastern advance. \"There is no military solution,\" Serraj said in the statement. OFFENSIVE? Analysts doubt the LNA is capable of launching a full-scale attack as it has stretched itself with the southern advance and it also relies on tribesmen and other auxiliary forces. Some diplomats say the advance is mainly a psychological campaign to pressure Serraj into a power-sharing deal on eastern terms, allowing Haftar to become commander of a national army. The confrontation is in any case a major setback for the U.N and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar. Both men had met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power sharing deal and a national conference is set to follow this month to agree on a road map for elections. Some of Haftar's supporters have called the U.N. efforts a waste of time, urging him to carry out a military solution to establish himself as national army commander. During the day the LNA had turned up pressure on Tripoli, warning of a military campaign to \"liberate the homeland from terrorism\". \"We expect the women of Tripoli to welcome the Libyan army like the women of Benghazi and Derna did,\" said Mismari, referring to two eastern cities which the LNA took by force. Mismari also called on young people in Tripoli to focus on the battle between LNA and Daesh, or Islamic State, in another hint that military action might be looming. The comments suggest the LNA might seek to takeover Tripoli working with local groups instead of seeking an invasion. In January, the LNA, which is loyal to Haftar, started a campaign to take control of the south and its oilfields with a similar rhetoric. The announcements coincided with the arrival in Tripoli of U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres who is on a regional tour seeking to help avoid a confrontation between the rival Libyan camps. On another potential frontline, a resident in Ras Lanuf, an oil town located on the coastal road, said tanks and military convoys were seen heading westwards in the direction of Sirte. Sirte is in central Libya controlled by a force from the western city of Mistrata allied to the Tripoli administration. Misrata, a port east of Tripoli, is home to powerful armed groups, which could match at least partly the firepower of LNA ground troops, analysts say. Haftar's forces enjoy air superiority.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Ayman al-Warfalli and Ahmed Elumami</p> <p>BENGHAZI, Libya/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan military forces have moved to western Libya and were briefly locked in a skirmish with a rival force south of the capital Tripoli, an eastern official and residents said on Wednesday, in an escalation between rival camps in the oil producer.</p> <p>The advance took diplomats and analysts by surprise, exploiting their focus on neighboring Algeria where President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday after protests, to the relieve of Western countries valuing stability there.</p> <p>Libya -- in trouble since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 -- is divided between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel administration allied to Khalifa Haftar.</p> <p>Haftar has turned into major player in the North African country, enjoying the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which see him as bulwark against Islamists.

Trudeau told an emergency meeting of legislators on Tuesday that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott had undermined the party and betrayed its trust. The almost two-month old scandal centered on Wilson-Raybould, who in February said officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would escape a corruption trial. In recent weeks, senior party figures and lawmakers had grown frustrated with Trudeau's handling of the crisis, especially since both former ministers remained in the caucus despite their open hostility. A long list of ministers and Liberal parliamentarians echoed Trudeau's emphasis on party unity on Wednesday, but the opposition reiterated that the expulsions were proof of a cover up. It is too soon to say whether Trudeau's problems are over, political analysts said. \"This scandal has blotted out the sun. Now the question is, did he kill it?\" said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker. Last week Ipsos put the Conservative Party 10 points ahead of the Liberals, thanks to the SNC-Lavalin affair. \"This issue has taken Trudeau into a territory where he could really lose,\" Bricker said, adding that while the prime minister had now shored up his standing as party leader, he still must win back public opinion. But another pollster, Frank Graves at Ekos, said there were signs the damage had been limited and that there was fatigue over the issue among the general public. Ekos polls showed the Liberals had lost 3-4 percentage points during the scandal. \"But the numbers we are seeing now are same as they were before,\" Graves said. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, who quit as minister because she disagreed with how the SNC Lavalin affair was being managed, stood side-by-side while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. They said they had defended the independence of the judiciary and had no regrets, but they stopped short of attacking Trudeau head on or threatening legal recourse. The affair has hurt the prime minister's image as a self-avowed feminist and a leader who has taken to heart the cause of Canada's indigenous population. He recruited candidates such as Wilson-Raybould, who was named as the first indigenous justice minister, and Philpott in part because they were new to politics. During a special event in parliament aimed at encouraging more women to get involved in politics, some of the attendees turned their backs on Trudeau as he spoke, prompting several of his Cabinet ministers to come to his defense. \"We have a strong prime minister that is a feminist,\" Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters. \"I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things. There's no male or female definition of loyalty.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed to adequately consider the extent to which the Republican-led states' plans would cause significant numbers of people to lose coverage. The decisions came in separate lawsuits by Kentucky and Arkansas residents enrolled in Medicaid. It marked a setback for efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to scale back the joint federal-and-state healthcare program. \"The court reaffirmed the rights of financially insecure individuals to access health care,\" said Sam Brooke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Southern Poverty Law Center. But Adam Meier of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services called the ruling \"illogical\" because it did not take into account whether the state's program was actually helping enrollees. “Although a setback to our implementation schedule, we believe that we have an excellent record for appeal and are currently considering next steps,” Meier said in a statement. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, said in a separate statement he was disappointed by the ruling. Representatives for HHS did not respond to requests for comment. Kentucky and Arkansas are among eight states that have received approval by HHS to impose requirements that people seeking coverage under Medicaid engage in work or job training. HHS approved those projects as part of a push to put a conservative stamp on Medicaid, which expanded in 36 states following the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. In Arkansas' case, the state had already implemented its work requirements, causing about 16,000 Arkansans to lose Medicaid coverage after HHS failed to consider whether the state's plan would help its citizens, Boasberg wrote. His ruling in Kentucky's case marked the second time Boasberg had vacated the approval of an HHS waiver needed by the state to move forward with its work requirements. In his June 2018 ruling, Boasberg said HHS had failed to grapple with the fact that an estimated 100,000 people would lose Medicaid coverage. HHS, in reapproving Kentucky's program, sought to address that issue by arguing that figure was dwarfed by the 450,000 who would lose coverage if Kentucky moved forward with repealing its expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. But Boasberg said adopting that position would allow the department to justify approving any proposed plan by a state \"as long as it is accompanied by a threat that the state will de-expand\" Medicaid.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Nate Raymond</p> <p>(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday overturned the Trump administration's approval of plans by Kentucky and Arkansas to impose work requirements on people seeking Medicaid health insurance benefits.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed to adequately consider the extent to which the Republican-led states' plans would cause significant numbers of people to lose coverage.</p> <p>The decisions came in separate lawsuits by Kentucky and Arkansas residents enrolled in Medicaid.

Elected to tackle graft and rising violence, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has vowed wrongdoers no mercy. But his first weeks in office have been blighted by in-fighting, scraps with Congress and a sluggish economy that are hurting his poll numbers and prompting concerns he may fail to deliver. \"Concerns over public security have been big issues, whether in the presidential or state elections, and certainly, we hope that will bring good results for our company,\" said Elton Borgonovo, country manager of Motorola Solutions Inc , which was promoting its body camera technology. Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, is struggling to get traction for his landmark pension reform, open up the country's hidebound economy and accelerate the recovery from a long recession. For companies that rely on state and federal government contracts, success is likely to depend on the state of Brazil's public finances, said Jean-Luc Alfonsi, vice president of Airbus SE subsidiary Helibras, a helicopter manufacturer. As such, he added, the approval of pension reform was crucial, a necessary condition to give Brazilian governments and private customers financial stability to make major purchases. \"Public finances are a result of politics, so we're waiting to see if the new administration and lawmakers will work together to clarify the country's budgetary policy,\" he said. Marcos Fellipe, a sales representative for chemicals, defense and aerospace company IPI do Brasil, the local unit of U.S. firm Island Group Enterprises, said he was hopeful Bolsonaro would relax trade restrictions and attack bureaucracy. \"But so far, I haven't seen any change,\" he said, adding that after taking part in three LAAD fairs, he had not seen one so empty, which he attributed to Brazil's economy. Shortly after taking office, Bolsonaro signed a temporary decree making it easier for Brazilians to buy guns - a move that Fellipe thought would bolster his munitions business. However, he said the move to loosen gun controls, which he called \"timid,\" had not had any noticeable effect on sales. One of the immediate winners of Bolsonaro's gun decree was Brazilian gun manufacturer Taurus Armas SA, whose shares rose ahead of the measure, but have since tumbled. Speaking at LAAD on Tuesday, Taurus Chief Executive Salesio Nuhs praised Bolsonaro's administration. \"I think Brazil is in a better phase, and we think this government will really bring growth for our country, and ... things will improve,\" he told Reuters. While Taurus waits for a gradual expansion of Brazil's arms market, Nuhs said the company will double its production capacity this year in the United States, where it ranks fourth in sales. Other executives at the Rio fair, however, wanted to see Brazil open up more quickly, with new tenders for international firms that have struggled across Latin America in recent years. \"I would like to see more business ... and I hope Brazil will get out of the crisis to push these projects forward,\" said Bernhard Brenner, Airbus Defence and Space's executive vice president of marketing and sales. He added that it was too soon to know whether Bolsonaro's law-and-order focus would translate into better sales. \"Ask me in two years,\" he said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Gabriel Stargardter</p> <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Global defense and security firms gathered at Latin America's biggest security expo in Rio de Janeiro this week hope Brazil's crackdown on crime will bolster sales to the new right-wing government even as they fret about the weak economy and tough political climate.</p> <p>Elected to tackle graft and rising violence, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has vowed wrongdoers no mercy.

Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the country's constitution to assume the interim presidency after declaring President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud. He has been recognized by the United States and most other Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, and has said he does not recognize decisions emanating from the Maduro government. The Constituent Assembly's decree is necessary for the Supreme Court to move ahead with a trial of Guaido because as a legislator he has parliamentary immunity that makes it more difficult for him to be tried than the average citizen. \"This formally authorizes the continuation of the trial (of Guaido),\" said Constituent Assembly Chief Diosdado Cabello, who is also the Vice President of the Socialist Party. The Supreme Court on Monday had reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country, an order which he openly violated in February when he embarked on a tour of Latin American nations to bolster support for his campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela's chief prosecutor's office has opened an investigation of Guaido, into alleged links to \"incidents of violence\" in January, but has not ordered his detention or officially charged him with any crime. \"We are not going to evade our responsibility,\" Guaido told reporters in eastern Caracas after the announcement. \"They thought this would be easy. But it won't be. If they want to move forward, they will have to assume the consequences.\" Constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro called the decision a \"constitutional fraud\" that stripped Guaido of parliamentary immunity without the approval of the legislature, which under the constitution must approve such a decision. The legislature is currently control by the opposition. \"It also violated due process, because he should have had a hearing to defend himself,\" said Haro in a telephone interview. Maduro has said Guaido should \"face justice\" and calls him a coup-mongering puppet for the United States - but he has stopped short of calling for his arrest. Guaido's international backers, chiefly the Trump administration, have warned Venezuelan authorities not to touch him and threatened ever harsher sanctions against the Maduro administration to further cut it off from foreign financing.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Angus Berwick and Vivian Sequera</p> <p>CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislature controlled by the ruling Socialist Party, on Tuesday approved a measure allowing for a trial of opposition leader Juan Guaido, in what appeared to be step toward having him arrested.</p> <p>Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the country's constitution to assume the interim presidency after declaring President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud.</p> <p>He has been recognized by the United States and most other Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, and has said he does not recognize decisions emanating from the Maduro government.</p> <p>The Constituent Assembly's decree is necessary for the Supreme Court to move ahead with a trial of Guaido because as a legislator he has parliamentary immunity that makes it more difficult for him to be tried than the average citizen.</p> <p>\"This formally authorizes the continuation of the trial (of Guaido),\" said Constituent Assembly Chief Diosdado Cabello, who is also the Vice President of the Socialist Party. </p> <p>The Supreme Court on Monday had reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country, an order which he openly violated in February when he embarked on a tour of Latin American nations to bolster support for his campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p> <p>Venezuela's chief prosecutor's office has opened an investigation of Guaido, into alleged links to \"incidents of violence\" in January, but has not ordered his detention or officially charged him with any crime.</p> <p>\"We are not going to evade our responsibility,\" Guaido told reporters in eastern Caracas after the announcement. \"They thought this would be easy.

A letter to President Donald Trump’s top advisers signed by more than 40 lawmakers said China’s actions in its western region of Xinjiang “may constitute crimes against humanity” and urged tighter U.S. export controls to ensure that U.S. companies are not assisting the Chinese government’s crackdown there, either directly or indirectly. It also asked the United States to strengthen financial disclosure requirements to alert American investors about the presence in U.S. capital markets of Chinese companies that are “complicit in human rights abuses.” The letter specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which produce audio-visual equipment that can be used for surveillance. China faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that U.N. experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims. Beijing has said its measures in Xinjiang, which are also reported to include widespread surveillance of the population, are aimed at stemming the threat of Islamist militancy. The facilities or camps that have opened are vocational training centers, the government has said. The letter, which was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, urged them to swiftly slap sanctions on Xinjiang's Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, a member of the Chinese leadership’s powerful politburo, and other Chinese officials “complicit in gross violations of human rights.” The Trump administration has been weighing sanctions against Chinese officials, including Chen, since late last year, and though it has ramped up criticism it has held off on imposing the measures. China has warned that it would retaliate \"in proportion\" against any U.S. sanctions. “We are disappointed with the administration’s failure so far to impose any sanctions related to the ongoing systemic and egregious human rights abuses in Xinjiang,” the lawmakers said. \"While the strong rhetoric condemning the Chinese government’s actions (in Xinjiang) from Vice President Pence and others is certainly welcomed, words alone are not enough.\" The group of signatories was led by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Chris Smith on the Republican side and Senator Bob Menendez and Representative James McGovern on the Democratic side.

Three of the women - blogger Eman al-Nafjan, academic Aziza al-Yousef and conservative preacher Ruqayya al-Mohareb - were temporarily released last week on condition they attend future hearings. They were seen entering Riyadh's criminal courthouse on Wednesday, and sources familiar with the proceedings told Reuters the three-judge panel adjourned their hearings until after the holy month of Ramadan, which ends in early June. The court had been expected to rule on release requests for the other women, but the sources said no decision was announced and their next hearing was set for April 17. The reason for the separate dates was unclear. In court on Wednesday, the public prosecutor replied to defenses the women had presented previously, the sources said. Few charges have been made public, but the brother of defendant Loujain al-Hathloul has said those against her include communicating with journalists, applying for a job at the United Nations, and attending digital privacy training. Western diplomats and media, including Reuters, have been denied entry to the trial, which has drawn attention to a rights record already in the spotlight after the murder last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. Three dozen countries, including all 28 EU members, Canada and Australia, have called on Riyadh to free the activists. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue during recent visits. WESTERN SCRUTINY The temporary releases and the case's transfer from a high-security terrorism court at the last minute without explanation may signal a more lenient handling after months of lobbying by Western governments. Yet it remains to be seen if Riyadh will bend to international pressure or pursue harsh sentences in a case critics say has revealed the limits of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's promises to modernize Saudi Arabia. Hathloul's siblings said on Twitter that the prosecution on Wednesday repeated its denials of the torture allegations made by some defendants during last week's hearing. Rights groups have documented mistreatment in detention including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault. Hathloul's brother has publicly appealed to members of the U.S. Congress to intervene, and her sister wrote an op-ed in the New York Times detailing the allegations. They both live abroad but say they have been pressured to keep quiet. \"We were silent and the most terrible forms of torture happened,\" the sister tweeted on Wednesday. \"I will be silent when Loujain is back with us and those who tortured her are put on trial and she is compensated for what happened.\" Most of the women on trial were arrested weeks before a ban on women driving cars in the conservative kingdom was lifted last June.

That leaves Algeria extraordinarily in the hands of a caretaker government until elections in three months and with no successor in sight. However, protesters made quickly clear that they would accept no new president from \"le pouvoir\", the popular nickname for the entrenched establishment of elderly veterans, business tycoons and National Liberation Front (FLN) party functionaries. \"What is important to us is that we do not accept the (caretaker) government,\" Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and protest leader, told Reuters just before Bouteflika stepped down. \"Peaceful protests will continue.\" Ali Benflis, a former head of the ruling FLN party, said other leading figures should also quit, naming Abdelkader Bensalah, chairman of the upper house who is standing in for Bouteflika for 90 days, interim premier Noureddine Bedoui and constitutional council head Tayeb Belai. \"The Algerian people have just closed one of the darkest chapters in the history of our country,\" he said in a statement, calling the protest a \"peaceful popular revolution\" Protesters have brushed aside especially Bedoui, whom Bouteflika appointed on Sunday as his grip on power was fading. Bedoui is seen by many in the street as a stalwart of the ruling circles - as interior minister he oversaw elections which the opposition said were not free or fair. Algeria's streets were quiet on Wednesday but the next test for the interim rulers looms on Friday, the day of the weekly mass marches since Feb. 22. Bouteflika's exit is seen only as a first gesture for young Algerians demanding jobs in a country where one in every four under the age of 30 is unemployed in a highly statist, undiversified economy dependent on oil and gas exports. In an emotional letter published by state media, Bouteflika bade farewell to the nation, thanking Algerians several times for having him rule the country for 20 years. \"Algeria will soon have a new president and I pray that God will help him to pursue the ambitions and hopes of its brave children,\" he wrote. CORRUPTION AND CRONYISM The outpouring of dissent is also over systemic cronyism that has seen Algeria effectively run by Bouteflika's brothers, tycoons and ex-military intelligence officers since he suffered a stroke in 2013 and largely vanished from view, analysts say. Protests were initially ignited by Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth mandate in elections this month, since postponed, but the agenda broadened to calls for root-and-branch change. The top priority for any successor would be to liberalize the economy, shifting away from an expensive but unproductive welfare state, and create jobs for young people who comprise almost 70 percent of the population. The North African country has almost no foreign debt burden but its hard currency reserves have halved to $70 billion since 2014 due to a slide in volatile oil and gas prices. \"Definitely the top priority is to address economic issues to diversify away from oil and gas revenues,\" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. One name with an economic background respected by many protesters who has emerged as a potential successor is Ahmed Benbitour, who served as prime minister under Bouteflika before resigning over lack of progress on reforms. He is a technocrat with no ties to political parties, though he is also in his 70s like many senior Algerian officials. Earlier this week, in a sign of Bouteflika's imminent political demise, authorities seized the passports of a dozen politically connected businessmen under investigation for alleged corruption. One of them, Bouteflika loyalist Ali Haddad, has been taken into custody, Ennahar TV reported on Wednesday. \"Bouteflika's group captured the state, so the top priority for whoever replaces Bouteflika is really to re-connect with the millions of protesters who marched because they no longer trust the pouvoir,\" said independent analyst Farid Ferrahi. Western powers, some of which had demanded a peaceful solution, will be relieved at Bouteflika's departure, valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer, which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner in fighting Islamist militants. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he \"looks forward to a peaceful and democratic transition process that reflects the wishes of the Algerian people,\" a statement said.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed</p> <p>ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's caretaker government faces the prospect of persistent popular demands for the removal of a scletoric ruling elite and wholesale reforms after ailing 82-year-old President Abdelaziz Bouteflika quit in the face of mass protests.</p> <p>\"We want a president who understands what we want,\" 25-year old Bouzid Abdoun, an engineer at state-owned energy concern Sonelgaz, told Reuters on Wednesday. \"We want to live here, not to migrate to Europe.\"</p> <p>Bouteflika ended 20 years in power on Tuesday after a final nudge by the military following six weeks of protests calling for democratic reforms after almost 60 years of monolithic rule by veterans of the 1954-62 independence war against France.</p> <p>That leaves Algeria extraordinarily in the hands of a caretaker government until elections in three months and with no successor in sight.</p> <p>However, protesters made quickly clear that they would accept no new president from \"le pouvoir\", the popular nickname for the entrenched establishment of elderly veterans, business tycoons and National Liberation Front (FLN) party functionaries. </p> <p>\"What is important to us is that we do not accept the (caretaker) government,\" Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and protest leader, told Reuters just before Bouteflika stepped down. \"Peaceful protests will continue.\"</p> <p>Ali Benflis, a former head of the ruling FLN party, said other leading figures should also quit, naming Abdelkader Bensalah, chairman of the upper house who is standing in for Bouteflika for 90 days, interim premier Noureddine Bedoui and constitutional council head Tayeb Belai.</p> <p>\"The Algerian people have just closed one of the darkest chapters in the history of our country,\" he said in a statement, calling the protest a \"peaceful popular revolution\"</p> <p>Protesters have brushed aside especially Bedoui, whom Bouteflika appointed on Sunday as his grip on power was fading.

The Republicans and Democrats introduced the Venezuelan Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance and Development (VERDAD) Act more than two months after President Donald Trump's administration recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, seeking the departure of President Nicolas Maduro. Senator Bob Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, led the bill. He said the act would \"put teeth behind\" support for the Venezuelan people and provide tools for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the OPEC nation. \"This legislation will offer needed humanitarian assistance and support for Venezuela's long path to democratic order,\" said Republican Senator Marco Rubio, another sponsor, who has worked closely with Trump on Venezuela. The bill would provide $200 million in new aid for Venezuela and $200 million for neighboring countries taking in refugees. It would also revoke U.S. visas for relatives of sanctioned Venezuelans, remove sanctions on officials not involved in human rights abuses if they recognize Guaido, and require work with Latin American and European governments to implement their own sanctions. It also requires U.S. agencies to lead efforts to recover \"corrupt financial holdings\" of Venezuelan officials and accelerate planning with international financial institutions on Venezuela's economic restructuring. The bill would not provide temporary protected immigration status, or TPS, which would allow 70,000 Venezuelans already in the United States to remain. TPS proposals have faced some opposition in the Trump administration, which takes a hard line on immigration. Menendez told reporters on a conference call he hoped separate legislation seeking TPS could move concurrently with the VERDAD Act. He said the bill stood an excellent chance of moving ahead in the Senate, given its bipartisan support. \"It sends Maduro a message, as well as Russia and China that are helping to prop up Maduro,\" Menendez said. The bill's sponsors included eight Republicans - Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, Todd Young, Lindsey Graham, John Barrasso, Bill Cassidy and Josh Hawley - and seven Democrats - Menendez, Dick Durbin, Ben Cardin, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen, Michael Bennet and Chris Coons.

For 14 years Womersley has worked at \"home kill,\" shooting beasts for small farmers and cutting them up, but tough new gun laws to be adopted after the nation's worst mass murder by a lone gunman will require him to surrender another of his guns. \"Guns are a way of life for me, really,\" says Womersley, 48, who received his first firearm, a .22-calibre rifle, for his 12th birthday, and now hunts with his 15-year-old daughter. \"It's pretty much what I live and breathe.

In seconds, three cattle are dead on the damp ground. He gathers his knives and begins to cut them up. \"I shoot animals, I don't shoot targets. I shoot food,\" says Womersley. Wearing black overalls and gumboots for protection against the gore, he pushes the cattle on their sides, removes heads and hide and uses a hoist to load the carcasses on his refrigerated truck. Womersley was on a similar job in the hinterland beyond Christchurch on March 15, when a man in combat gear entered the city's Al Noor mosque, and then another, and turned his high-powered military-style weapons on unarmed worshippers. \"I didn't really comprehend it was real. I thought it was like a movie, or something that's happened overseas,\" Womersley says, adding that he had been shocked to discover after work what had unfolded just a few kilometers away. Fifty people were killed and scores wounded, prompting an outpouring of support for the nation's bereaved Muslim community, and a swift crackdown on guns. The semi-automatics used in the attack will be banned, with exemptions for working hunters, and tougher licensing rules are on the drawing board.

Zachary Baumel, who immigrated to Israel with his parents from New York in 1970, was 21 when he fought in Israel's invasion of Lebanon and was declared missing in action (MIA) along with two other soldiers in the Battle of Sultan Yacoub. \"The last words he wrote to his parents, on a postcard before Sultan Yacoub, were: \"Don't worry, everything is fine, but I probably won't be home for a while,'\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement. Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said Baumel's remains were flown to Israel by El Al Israel Airlines several days ago. Conricus declined to say how or where the body of Baumel, a tank crewman and sergeant, was recovered in what he described as an intelligence operation, and Netanyahu gave no details in his address. In 2018, Russia - which Netanyahu is due to visit for talks with President Vladimir Putin on Thursday - said its troops in Syria had been trying to locate the remains of Israeli soldiers killed in previous conflicts. Two other Israeli tank crew members are still listed by the military as missing in action from the June 10-11, 1982 battle. Over the years, there had been unverified reports that Baumel and the other soldiers missing at Sultan Yacoub, Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz, might have survived the fighting and been captured. The fate of Israeli air force navigator Ron Arad, whose plane crashed in Lebanon in 1986, has also never been clarified. Israel hoped forensic tests might determine if Baumel was killed outright or died under other circumstances, Conricus said. Baumel's father, Yona, who died in 2009, led an international campaign to discover whether his son might still be alive. \"Today, we are lifting the uncertainty and closing a circle,\" Netanyahu said, vowing continued efforts to discover the fate of Israel's other MIAs. He said Baumel's tank crewman overalls and Jewish religious garment were found with the soldier's remains. \"This is one of the most emotional moments I have experienced in all my years as prime minister,\" said Netanyahu, who has been in office for the past decade and is vying for a fifth term in a closely contested election on April 9. In 2016, in a ceremony attended in Moscow by Netanyahu, Russia returned an Israeli tank that had been captured by Syria at Sultan Yacoub and transferred to a Russian museum.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jeffrey Heller</p> <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has recovered the body of a U.S.-born Israeli soldier missing since a 1982 tank battle against Syrian forces, a case that had long vexed the nation, the military said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Zachary Baumel, who immigrated to Israel with his parents from New York in 1970, was 21 when he fought in Israel's invasion of Lebanon and was declared missing in action (MIA) along with two other soldiers in the Battle of Sultan Yacoub.</p> <p>\"The last words he wrote to his parents, on a postcard before Sultan Yacoub, were: \"Don't worry, everything is fine, but I probably won't be home for a while,'\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement.</p> <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said Baumel's remains were flown to Israel by El Al Israel Airlines several days ago.</p> <p>Conricus declined to say how or where the body of Baumel, a tank crewman and sergeant, was recovered in what he described as an intelligence operation, and Netanyahu gave no details in his address.</p> <p>In 2018, Russia - which Netanyahu is due to visit for talks with President Vladimir Putin on Thursday - said its troops in Syria had been trying to locate the remains of Israeli soldiers killed in previous conflicts.</p> <p>Two other Israeli tank crew members are still listed by the military as missing in action from the June 10-11, 1982 battle.</p> <p>Over the years, there had been unverified reports that Baumel and the other soldiers missing at Sultan Yacoub, Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz, might have survived the fighting and been captured. </p> <p>The fate of Israeli air force navigator Ron Arad, whose plane crashed in Lebanon in 1986, has also never been clarified.</p> <p>Israel hoped forensic tests might determine if Baumel was killed outright or died under other circumstances, Conricus said.</p> <p>Baumel's father, Yona, who died in 2009, led an international campaign to discover whether his son might still be alive.</p> <p>\"Today, we are lifting the uncertainty and closing a circle,\" Netanyahu said, vowing continued efforts to discover the fate of Israel's other MIAs.</p> <p>He said Baumel's tank crewman overalls and Jewish religious garment were found with the soldier's remains.</p> <p>\"This is one of the most emotional moments I have experienced in all my years as prime minister,\" said Netanyahu, who has been in office for the past decade and is vying for a fifth term in a closely contested election on April 9.</p> <p>In 2016, in a ceremony attended in Moscow by Netanyahu, Russia returned an Israeli tank that had been captured by Syria at Sultan Yacoub and transferred to a Russian museum.</p> <p></p>","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-syria-israel/israel-recovers-body-of-u-s-born-soldier-missing-since-1982-idUSKCN1RF204","scrape_datetime":"2019-04-04T12:45:24Z","breadcrumbs":[{"name":"World News","link":"https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/worldNews"}],"_type":"ArticleItem"},{"headline":"Turkish opposition demands mandate as Istanbul recount continues","datePublished":"2019-04-03T07:33:07","datePublishedRaw":"April 3, 2019 / 7:33 AM / in 20 hours","authorsList":["https://www.reuters.com/journalists/ece-toksabay","https://www.reuters.com/journalists/tuvan-gumrukcu"],"inLanguage":"en","mainImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190403&t=2&i=1372994618&r=LYNXNPEF320GS","description":"Turkey's main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board (YSK) on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city's 39 districts.","articleBody":"By Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board (YSK) on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city's 39 districts. Initial results from Sunday's mayoral elections showed the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) had narrowly won control of Turkey's two biggest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, in a shock upset for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party. If those results are confirmed in the coming days, the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32.6 billion liras ($5.79 billion) for 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey's commercial hub, and the capital Ankara. Erdogan - who campaigned hard for the AKP ahead of the vote - would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities, possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession. However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara, saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities. In Istanbul, CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, and his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25,000 votes ahead, a relatively slim margin in a city of some 15 million people. The chairman of the Election Board (YSK), Sadi Guven, said on Wednesday it had ruled that the recount of what had been marked as invalid votes should go ahead in eight Istanbul districts, some of them AKP strongholds, but added that appeals were still underway. The state-run Anadolu news agency later said the YSK decided to recount invalid votes in 15 districts and all votes in three other districts as a result of the appeals. The AKP had said previously there were more than 300,000 invalid votes. Six of the 18 districts being recounted were initially won by the CHP, one by the nationalist MHP, and the rest by the AKP, according to Anadolu. Imamoglu called on the YSK to \"do its job\" and name him mayor, accusing the AKP of disrespecting the people of Istanbul. \"We want justice. We demand our mandate from the YSK, which has given the numbers, as the elected mayor of this city... The world is watching us,\" he told reporters. After Imamoglu spoke, the hashtag #MazbatamiziVerin (Give our Mandate) was the top trending topic on Twitter in Turkey. AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party was not doing anything illegal and added that the vote difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim had fallen to below 20,000 votes. \"We believe the reality will emerge tonight and we will all accept the results,\" Yavuz told reporters. LOCAL PURSE STRINGS Pro-government newspapers on Wednesday said there had been a conspiracy against Turkey in the local elections, with the Star newspaper likening this to an attempted military coup in 2016 and nationwide protests in 2013. Yeni Safak newspaper editor Ibrahim Karagul called for a second vote after what he termed a \"coup via elections\", adding without providing evidence that supporters of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen - blamed by Ankara for the 2016 coup attempt - were involved. In Ankara, opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50.9 percent of votes on Sunday, nearly 4 percentage points ahead of his AKP rival. Recounts were planned in 11 Ankara districts due to AKP appeals, Anadolu said. In some 100 rallies during his election campaign, Erdogan had described the opposition alliance as terrorist supporters linked to Gulen's network and Kurdish militants. Erdogan's political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey, but a recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira have taken their toll on the president's popularity. While Erdogan's ruling alliance won a nationwide majority of just under 52 percent of all votes, losing Ankara and Istanbul - where he started his political life - would significantly dent his dominance. \"It is by controlling the municipality that you keep your support happy because it is at the municipal level that you give away lots of things to your core base,\" said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of Teneo political risk advisers. While official results have not yet been announced, Erdogan has said his alliance had won the majority of municipal councils across Istanbul and Ankara. The AKP has said this was a sign of irregularity in the vote count. Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the Turkish lira, which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago, reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors. The lira was flat on Wednesday but slipped 2 percent on Tuesday after relations with Washington soured following a U.S. decision to halt delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F-35 fighter aircraft. Adding to investor concerns over fraying diplomatic ties and possible U.S. sanctions over the F-35 aircraft and missile defence, the U.S. State Department urged Ankara to respect the \"legitimate election results.\" Ankara responded by warning against foreign interference and \"any steps that may be construed as meddling in Turkey's internal affairs.\"","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu</p> <p>ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board (YSK) on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city's 39 districts.</p> <p>Initial results from Sunday's mayoral elections showed the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) had narrowly won control of Turkey's two biggest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, in a shock upset for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party.</p> <p>If those results are confirmed in the coming days, the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32.6 billion liras ($5.79 billion) for 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey's commercial hub, and the capital Ankara.</p> <p>Erdogan - who campaigned hard for the AKP ahead of the vote - would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities, possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession. </p> <p>However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara, saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities.</p> <p>In Istanbul, CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, and his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25,000 votes ahead, a relatively slim margin in a city of some 15 million people.</p> <p>The chairman of the Election Board (YSK), Sadi Guven, said on Wednesday it had ruled that the recount of what had been marked as invalid votes should go ahead in eight Istanbul districts, some of them AKP strongholds, but added that appeals were still underway.</p> <p>The state-run Anadolu news agency later said the YSK decided to recount invalid votes in 15 districts and all votes in three other districts as a result of the appeals.

The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is struggling to respond to what many in western Europe see as creeping authoritarianism in the eastern wing of the bloc, especially Poland, Hungary and Romania. The Commission's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said more needed to be done to strengthen the rule of law in the EU. \"The Union's capacity to uphold the rule of law is essential, now more than ever,\" he told a news conference. \"First because it is an issue of fundamental values, a matter of ‘who we are'. Second, because the functioning of the EU as a whole depends on the rule of law in all member states.\" He said the Commission had launched a new infringement procedure against Poland over a disciplinary regime for judges introduced by the right-wing government in Warsaw, and he also warned Romania not to backtrack on its judiciary reforms. Poland's ruling PiS party has pursued an overhaul of the judiciary since taking power in late-2015. Under one of the changes, judges could be subjected to a disciplinary investigation and ultimately sanctions if authorities deemed their rulings inappropriate. \"The new disciplinary regime undermines the judicial independence of Polish judges by not offering necessary guarantees to protect them from political control, as required by the Court of Justice of the European Union,\" Timmermans said. The Polish disciplinary chamber is composed solely of judges selected by the National Council for the Judiciary whose members have been appointed by the ruling PiS majority in parliament. The Commission also said the new disciplinary regime empowered the head of the disciplinary chamber to decide, on an ad-hoc basis and with an almost unfettered discretion, whether the disciplinary court of first instance heard a given case. The Polish government has two months to reply to the Commission's complaints. ROMANIAN IMPUNITY The Commission also on Wednesday rebuked Romania, which is planning two emergency decrees altering judicial legislation. Critics say they are aimed at scuppering corruption cases or convictions of politicians, especially from the ruling Social Democrats. \"I want to warn against any governmental action that would disrupt the Romanian judicial system by creating a systemic de facto impunity for high office holders who were sentenced for corruption,\" Timmermans said. \"Such a move would compel the Commission to act swiftly,\" he said without specifying what the EU executive would do. The embassies of the United States, Canada and 10 EU member states including France and Germany issued a joint appeal on Wednesday to Bucharest to scrap the decrees. Separately on Wednesday, the head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tarjani, expressed concern over Bucharest's decision to press charges against Romania's former anti-corruption chief, Laura Codruta Kovesi, who is the chamber's preferred candidate for EU chief prosecutor. Transparency International ranks Romania among the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels, which keeps its justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft. Poland is already subject to an unprecedented EU rule-of-law procedure since end-2017 over its judiciary reforms. The process could in theory result in Poland losing its EU voting rights, though this is unlikely because all other 27 EU member states would have to agree. Hungary has vowed to veto such a move. The Commission, guardian of the EU treaties, has already opened two infringement procedures against Poland, in mid-2017 and in mid-2018, over changes to retirement provisions for Polish judges and the possible impact on their independence. The EU has also opened a rule-of-law procedure against Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban has clashed with Brussels over his reforms of the judiciary, migration and the independence of media and non-governmental organizations. Timmermans said a strengthened rule-of-law framework in the EU would better promote adherence to EU legal values and prevent rule-of-law breaches before they occur. The Commission will make proposals in that direction in June, Timmermans added.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Jan Strupczewski</p> <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission stepped up its defense of judicial independence and rule of law across the EU on Wednesday, announcing new legal measures against Poland and cautioning Romania not to pardon corrupt politicians.</p> <p>The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is struggling to respond to what many in western Europe see as creeping authoritarianism in the eastern wing of the bloc, especially Poland, Hungary and Romania.</p> <p>The Commission's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said more needed to be done to strengthen the rule of law in the EU.</p> <p>\"The Union's capacity to uphold the rule of law is essential, now more than ever,\" he told a news conference. \"First because it is an issue of fundamental values, a matter of ‘who we are'.

The meeting, which a Vatican statement on Wednesday called a \"spiritual retreat\", could increase the chances of a visit by the pope to the South Sudanese capital, Juba. The leaders will include President Salva Kiir, First Vice President and former rebel leader Riek Machar and the other four vice presidents and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, told reporters. \"We know the pope wants to go there and we know that the situation has improved a little, especially after the agreement was signed, and also because of the good will of the people who are involved the situation,\" Parolin said. Oil-producing South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, descended into civil war in December 2013 when a dispute between Kiir and Machar -- who was vice president then -- sparked fighting, often along ethnic lines. In September the two sides signed a power-sharing deal calling on the main rival factions to assemble, screen and train their respective forces and unify them into a national army before the formation of a unity government next month. That has not happened. The government, which has faced frequent international criticism over corruption and rights abuses, blames a lack of funding from donors. \"It will be a moment of spirituality and above all, it will help make them aware of the responsibility that politicians and authorities have,\" Parolin said on the sidelines of a conference on religious freedom at the U.S. embassy to the Vatican. All six of the leaders are Christian, as is more than half the population of South Sudan. Sudan is predominantly Muslim. About 400,000 people have been killed and more than a third of the country's 12 million people uprooted by the civil war - a conflict punctuated by multiple rounds of mediation followed by renewed bloodshed. The conflict sparked Africa's worst refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide and plunged parts of the country into famine. More than 875,000 refugees have fled into neighboring Uganda since the war broke out. Parolin said the pope, who met Kiir at the Vatican on March 16, would attend at least part of the retreat. Last month, the Vatican said the pope had asked aides to resume planning for a visit that was scrapped in 2017 because of security concerns. A Church source said the retreat would be held on April 10-11.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Philip Pullella</p> <p>VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will host the divided leaders of South Sudan at the Vatican next week to help them solidify a faltering peace agreement ending the civil war in the world's youngest country.</p> <p>The meeting, which a Vatican statement on Wednesday called a \"spiritual retreat\", could increase the chances of a visit by the pope to the South Sudanese capital, Juba.</p> <p>The leaders will include President Salva Kiir, First Vice President and former rebel leader Riek Machar and the other four vice presidents and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, told reporters.</p> <p>\"We know the pope wants to go there and we know that the situation has improved a little, especially after the agreement was signed, and also because of the good will of the people who are involved the situation,\" Parolin said.</p> <p>Oil-producing South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, descended into civil war in December 2013 when a dispute between Kiir and Machar -- who was vice president then -- sparked fighting, often along ethnic lines.</p> <p>In September the two sides signed a power-sharing deal calling on the main rival factions to assemble, screen and train their respective forces and unify them into a national army before the formation of a unity government next month.</p> <p>That has not happened.

Tria, a 70-year-old academic who is not a member of either of the ruling parties - the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - has often struggled to get along with his political backers. \"All ministers should stay calm ... there is nothing on the agenda,\" Conte said during a visit to Qatar when asked about rumors that Tria could quit. Simmering tensions erupted this week over what 5-Star sees as Tria's reluctance to approve a decree to reimburse savers who suffered losses in a series of bank collapses. The government has set aside 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) for the reimbursement, which was among 5-Star's campaign promises ahead of last year's election. Tria fears it will fall foul of European Union rules governing bank rescues. He has drawn up a compromise proposal which would automatically reimburse less-affluent savers, and set up a special commission to judge the claims of better-off investors. However, this has not satisfied 5-Star, which is struggling in opinion polls and fears it will be accused of reneging on a core election promise. \"Tria can't decide this on his own. We will have savers on the streets,\" a senior 5-Star lawmaker who asked not to be named told Reuters. A source close to Tria said the minister had already got the European Commission to informally sign off on his plan, and \"if 5-Star upset everything there will be no reimbursements and it will be the poorest savers who suffer\". Tria himself dismissed speculation he was ready to resign as \"rubbish\", in comments to daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday. \"If I were to go, we'd have to see how markets would react,\" he was quoted as saying. Tria has repeatedly clashed with the ruling parties since the government was formed last June, especially during a drawn-out tussle over Rome's 2019 budget when he wanted to commit to a lower deficit than they did. The League is taking a back seat in the latest hostilities but this could change if they escalate, because it will be reluctant to allow 5-Star to be seen as the main champion of savers' rights. The League has overtaken 5-Star as Italy's most popular party, according to opinion polls, with both campaigning hard ahead of European parliamentary elections next month. \"Tria's position is not in question at the moment, but anything can happen after the European vote,\" a senior League lawmaker told Reuters.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Giuseppe Fonte and Gavin Jones</p> <p>ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday ruled out that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is under fire from within the ruling coalition, could step down.</p> <p>Tria, a 70-year-old academic who is not a member of either of the ruling parties - the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - has often struggled to get along with his political backers.</p> <p>\"All ministers should stay calm ... there is nothing on the agenda,\" Conte said during a visit to Qatar when asked about rumors that Tria could quit.</p> <p>Simmering tensions erupted this week over what 5-Star sees as Tria's reluctance to approve a decree to reimburse savers who suffered losses in a series of bank collapses.</p> <p>The government has set aside 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) for the reimbursement, which was among 5-Star's campaign promises ahead of last year's election.

Like other Western countries, Germany faces a conundrum of how to deal with citizens who travel to the Middle East to join violent Islamist causes like IS whose self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" was eliminated last month. The measure, which needs parliamentary approval, would exclude minors, cover only future cases, and not apply to single nationality Germans who could otherwise be left stateless. \"This will send a signal to IS supporters, to those thinking of traveling to IS areas,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters. More than 1,000 Germans have left their country for Middle East war zones since 2013 and the government has been debating how to deal with them as U.S.-backed forces took IS's last patch of territory in Syria and rounded up prisoners. About a third have returned to Germany, another third are believed to have died, and the rest are thought to be still in Iraq and Syria, including those detained by Iraqi forces and U.S.-backed fighters in Syria, according to German intelligence officials. In February, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Britain, France and Germany to take back more than 800 captured Islamic State fighters and put them on trial. Germany said it would take back fighters only if the suspects have consular access, adding that in principle, all of its citizens and those suspected of having fought for IS have the right to return. In one high-profile case, Britain in February revoked the citizenship of a teenager who had left London aged 15 to join IS in Syria. The case of Shamima Begum highlighted the security, legal and ethical dilemmas facing European governments dealing with those who swore allegiance to a group determined to destroy the West. Germany joined the military campaign against IS militants in Syria in a support role by deploying Tornado reconnaissance jets, refuelling aircraft and a frigate to the region, after an appeal from close partner France for Berlin to do more.","articleBodyRaw":"<p>By Paul Carrel</p> <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germans with a second nationality who fight abroad for groups like Islamic State will lose their citizenship, the cabinet agreed in a draft law on Wednesday intended to deter future militants. </p> <p>Like other Western countries, Germany faces a conundrum of how to deal with citizens who travel to the Middle East to join violent Islamist causes like IS whose self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" was eliminated last month.</p> <p>The measure, which needs parliamentary approval, would exclude minors, cover only future cases, and not apply to single nationality Germans who could otherwise be left stateless.</p> <p>\"This will send a signal to IS supporters, to those thinking of traveling to IS areas,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters.</p> <p>More than 1,000 Germans have left their country for Middle East war zones since 2013 and the government has been debating how to deal with them as U.S.-backed forces took IS's last patch of territory in Syria and rounded up prisoners.</p> <p>About a third have returned to Germany, another third are believed to have died, and the rest are thought to be still in Iraq and Syria, including those detained by Iraqi forces and U.S.-backed fighters in Syria, according to German intelligence officials.</p> <p>In February, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Britain, France and Germany to take back more than 800 captured Islamic State fighters and put them on trial. </p> <p>Germany said it would take back fighters only if the suspects have consular access, adding that in principle, all of its citizens and those suspected of having fought for IS have the right to return.</p> <p>In one high-profile case, Britain in February revoked the citizenship of a teenager who had left London aged 15 to join IS in Syria.
